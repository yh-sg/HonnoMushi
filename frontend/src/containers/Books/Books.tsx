// description: "Leah Burke√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùgirl-band drummer, master of deadpan, and Simon Spier√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s best friend from the award-winning Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùtakes center stage in this novel of first love and senior-year angst.When it comes to drumming, Leah Burke is usually on beat√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùbut real life isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t always so rhythmic. An anomaly in her friend group, she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the only child of a young, single mom, and her life is decidedly less privileged. She loves to draw but is too self-conscious to show it. And even though her mom knows she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s bisexual, she hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mustered the courage to tell her friends√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùnot even her openly gay BFF, Simon.So Leah really doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what to do when her rock-solid friend group starts to fracture in unexpected ways. With prom and college on the horizon, tensions are running high. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hard for Leah to strike the right note while the people she loves are fighting√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùespecially when she realizes she might love one of them more than she ever intended.";
