But Circe is a strange childâ€”not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess powerâ€”the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":393,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.34"},"rating_count":61357,"review_count":9369,"genres":"Fantasy|Fiction|Fantasy|Mythology|Historical|Historical Fiction|Retellings","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1508879575l/35959740.jpg"}

Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her 'head-for-the-hills bag'. In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":334,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.47"},"rating_count":128337,"review_count":16424,"genres":"Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1506026635l/35133922.jpg"}

Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called 'the Golden State Killer.' Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.At the time of the crimes, the Golden State Killer was between the ages of eighteen and thirty, Caucasian, and athleticâ€”capable of vaulting tall fences. He always wore a mask. After choosing a victimâ€”he favored suburban couplesâ€”he often entered their home when no one was there, studying family pictures, mastering the layout. He attacked while they slept, using a flashlight to awaken and blind them. Though they could not recognize him, his victims recalled his voice: a guttural whisper through clenched teeth, abrupt and threatening.Iâ€™ll Be Gone in the Darkâ€”the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden deathâ€”offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a womanâ€™s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Framed by an introduction by Gillian Flynn and an afterword by her husband, Patton Oswalt, the book was completed by Michelleâ€™s lead researcher and a close colleague. Utterly original and compelling, it is destined to become a true crime classicâ€”and may at last unmask the Golden State Killer.","edition":"","format":"ebook","pages":352,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.22"},"rating_count":60784,"review_count":7148,"genres":"Nonfiction|Crime|True Crime|Mystery|Crime|Mystery|Audiobook","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1499131009l/35068432.jpg"}

Kuang","description":"When Rin aced the Keju, the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies, it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldnâ€™t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rinâ€™s guardians, who believed theyâ€™d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard, the most elite military school in Nikan, was even more surprising.But surprises arenâ€™t always good.Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly powerâ€”an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much aliveâ€”and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . .Rinâ€™s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.","edition":"","format":"ebook","pages":544,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.06"},"rating_count":10111,"review_count":2418,"genres":"Fantasy|Historical|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Adult|Historical|Young Adult|War|Fantasy|Magic|Fantasy|High Fantasy|Did Not Finish","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1515691735l/35068705.jpg"}

It is here, on this momentous day, that Amar, the youngest of the siblings, reunites with his family for the first time in three years. Rafiq and Layla must now contend with the choices and betrayals that lead to their son's estrangement - the reckoning of parents who strove to pass on their cultures and traditions to their children; and of children who in turn struggle to balance authenticity in themselves with loyalty to the home they came from.In a narrative that spans decades and sees family life through the eyes of each member, A Place For Us charts the crucial moments in the family's past, from the bonds that bring them together to the differences that pull them apart. And as siblings Hadia, Huda, and Amar attempt to carve out a life for themselves, they must reconcile their present culture with their parent's faith, to tread a path between the old world and the new, and learn how the smallest decisions can lead to the deepest of betrayals.A deeply affecting and resonant story, A Place for Us is truly a book for our times: a moving portrait of what it means to be an American family today, a novel of love, identity and belonging that eloquently examines what it means to be both American and Muslim -- and announces Fatima Farheen Mirza as a major new literary talent.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":385,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.17"},"rating_count":13447,"review_count":2339,"genres":"Fiction|Contemporary|Literary Fiction","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1517006183l/36840397.jpg"}

Calla never looked back, and at twenty-six, a busy life in Toronto is all she knows. But when Calla learns that Wrenâ€™s days may be numbered, she knows that itâ€™s time to make the long trip back to the remote frontier town where she was born.She braves the roaming wildlife, the odd daylight hours, the exorbitant prices, and even the occasionalâ€”dear Godâ€”outhouse, all for the chance to connect with her father: a man who, despite his many faults, she canâ€™t help but care for. While she struggles to adjust to this rugged environment, Jonahâ€”the unkempt, obnoxious, and proud Alaskan pilot who helps keep her fatherâ€™s charter plane company operationalâ€”canâ€™t imagine calling anywhere else home. And heâ€™s clearly waiting with one hand on the throttle to fly this city girl back to where she belongs, convinced that sheâ€™s too pampered to handle the wild.Jonah is probably right, but Calla is determined to prove him wrong. Soon, she finds herself forming an unexpected bond with the burly pilot. As his undercurrent of disapproval dwindles, itâ€™s replaced by friendshipâ€”or perhaps something deeper? But Calla is not in Alaska to stay and Jonah will never leave. It would be foolish of her to kindle a romance, to take the same path her parents triedâ€”and failed atâ€”years ago.

You'd be wrong. When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations spent playing board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, except for one tiny, vexing realization: it's impossible to take a vacation from yourself.With Calypso, Sedaris sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny--it's a book that can make you laugh 'til you snort, the way only family can. Sedaris's powers of observation have never been sharper, and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled. But much of the comedy here is born out of that vertiginous moment when your own body betrays you and you realize that the story of your life is made up of more past than future.This is beach reading for people who detest beaches, required reading for those who loathe small talk and love a good tumor joke. Calypso is simultaneously Sedaris's darkest and warmest book yet--and it just might be his very best.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":272,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.23"},"rating_count":31925,"review_count":4050,"genres":"Nonfiction|Humor|Autobiography|Memoir|Writing|Essays|Audiobook","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1534856837l/35832073.jpg"}

This gifted scientist and writer re-creates the dinosaursâ€™ peak during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, when thousands of species thrived, and winged and feathered dinosaurs, the prehistoric ancestors of modern birds, emerged. The story continues to the end of the Cretaceous period, when a giant asteroid or comet struck the planet and nearly every dinosaur species (but not all) died out, in the most extraordinary extinction event in earthâ€™s history, one full of lessons for today as we confront a 'sixth extinction.'Brusatte also recalls compelling stories from his globe-trotting expeditions during one of the most exciting eras in dinosaur researchâ€”which he calls 'a new golden age of discovery'â€”and offers thrilling accounts of some of the remarkable findings he and his colleagues have made, including primitive human-sized tyrannosaurs; monstrous carnivores even larger than T. rex; and paradigm-shifting feathered raptors from China.","edition":"","format":"ebook","pages":416,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.22"},"rating_count":3524,"review_count":599,"genres":"Science|Nonfiction|History|Animals|Animals|Dinosaurs|Environment|Nature","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1516138953l/35068612.jpg"}

Poornima's father hires Savitha to work one of their sari looms, and the two girls are quickly drawn to one another. Savitha is even more impoverished than Poornima, but she is full of passion and energy. She shows Poornima how to find beauty in a bolt of indigo cloth, a bowl of yogurt rice and bananas, the warmth of friendship. Suddenly their Indian village doesn't feel quite so claustrophobic, and Poornima begins to imagine a life beyond the arranged marriage her father is desperate to lock down for her. But when a devastating act of cruelty drives Savitha away, Poornima leaves behind everything she has ever known to find her friend again. Her journey takes her into the darkest corners of India's underworld, on a harrowing cross-continental journey, and eventually to an apartment complex in Seattle. Alternating between the girlsâ€™ perspectives as they face relentless obstacles, Girls Burn Brighter introduces two heroines who never lose the hope that burns within them. In breathtaking prose, Shobha Rao tackles the most urgent issues facing women today: domestic abuse, human trafficking, immigration, and feminism.

To Chanelâ€™s best friend, who had just slipped out of the theater for a moment to take a call, it felt as unreal as the ancient black-and-white movie up on the screen. But Chanelâ€™s blood ran red, and her death was anything but fictional.Then, as Eve Dallas puzzles over a homicide that seems carefully planned and yet oddly personal, she receives a tip from an unexpected source: an author of police thrillers who recognizes the crimeâ€”from the pages of her own book. Dallas doesnâ€™t think itâ€™s coincidence, since a recent strangulation of a sex worker resembles a scene from her writing as well. Cops look for patterns of behavior: similar weapons, similar MOs.

The bad news is that time is running out before the next victim plays an unwitting role in a murdererâ€™s deranged private dramaâ€”and only Eve can put a stop to a creative impulse gone horribly, destructively wrong.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":372,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.28"},"rating_count":12405,"review_count":1260,"genres":"Mystery|Romance|Fiction|Mystery|Crime","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1515150029l/35466342.jpg"}

But as Hinton realized and accepted his fate, he resolved not only to survive, but find a way to live on Death Row.

Destined to be a classic memoir of wrongful imprisonment and freedom won, Hintonâ€™s memoir tells his dramatic thirty-year journey and shows how you can take away a manâ€™s freedom, but you canâ€™t take away his imagination, humor, or joy.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":272,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.63"},"rating_count":9018,"review_count":1737,"genres":"Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography|Crime|True Crime|Audiobook","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1496780260l/34964905.jpg"}

Having grown up worse than poor in South Dakota and reinvented herself as the most prominent woman reporter in America, 'Hick,' as she's known to her friends and admirers, is not quite instantly charmed by the idealistic, patrician Eleanor. But then, as her connection with the future first lady deepens into intimacy, what begins as a powerful passion matures into a lasting love, and a life that Hick never expected to have. She moves into the White House, where her status as 'first friend' is an open secret, as are FDR's own lovers. After she takes a job in the Roosevelt administration, promoting and protecting both Roosevelts, she comes to know Franklin not only as a great president but as a complicated rival and an irresistible friend, capable of changing lives even after his death. Through it all, even as Hick's bond with Eleanor is tested by forces both extraordinary and common, and as she grows as a woman and a writer, she never loses sight of the love of her life.From Washington, D.C. to Hyde Park, from a little white house on Long Island to an apartment on Manhattan's Washington Square, Amy Bloom's new novel moves elegantly through fascinating places and times, written in compelling prose and with emotional depth, wit, and acuity.","edition":"","format":"Paperback","pages":320,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.35"},"rating_count":11011,"review_count":1555,"genres":"Historical|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical|Lgbt","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1506236718l/35876524.jpg"}

A hot man, a one-night stand. Five days in Miami, that was the plan. Things went sideways real-quick. How could what started off as a five-day girlsâ€™ trip have careened so quickly out of control? I found myself in a fix. Just a small-town girl from a boring little city, my life might have even been described as charmed. Until it suddenly wasnâ€™t. My knight in all black armor swooped in to save my distressed damsel like a move right out of the super-hero playbook. The man was a ridiculous clichÃ©. Tall, dark, handsome and mysterious? Check! Garland wore power like a suit, possessed an ego on steroids, never minced words, and avoided messy entanglements like the plague. Prince Charming? Nope! He still drew me like a magnet.

Heck, I guess everybodyâ€™s got to make a charitable donation sometimes. And the man is nothing if not a giver. His words are seductive, his touch addictive, his mouth magical, and his body a weapon. I never stood a chance. But a snap decision has life altering consequences, and my world shifted in ways I couldnâ€™t have imagined.

One day, a mysterious package arrives on his doorstep, pulling him into a mesmerizing adventure to uncover the tangled history that binds the two sides of his family. For generations, the men of the al-Raqb family have served as watchmen of the storied Ibn Ezra Synagogue in Old Cairo, built at the site where the infant Moses was taken from the Nile. Joseph learns of his ancestor Ali, a Muslim orphan who nearly a thousand years earlier was entrusted as the first watchman of the synagogue and became enchanted by its legendary--perhaps magical--Ezra Scroll. The story of Joseph's family is entwined with that of the British twin sisters Agnes and Margaret, who in 1897 depart their hallowed Cambridge halls on a mission to rescue sacred texts that have begun to disappear from the synagogue.The Last Watchman of Old Cairo is a moving page-turner of a novel from acclaimed storyteller Michael David Lukas. This tightly woven multigenerational tale illuminates the tensions that have torn communities apart and the unlikely forces--potent magic, forbidden love--that boldly attempt to bridge that divide.Praise for The Last Watchman of Old Cairo'A beautiful, richly textured novel, ambitious and delicately crafted, The Last Watchman of Old Cairo is both a coming-of-age story and a family history, a wide-ranging book about fathers and sons, religion, magic, love, and the essence of storytelling.

A family retreat can be derailed by a prowling panther, or by a sexual secret. Among those navigating this place are a resourceful pair of abandoned sisters; a lonely boy, grown up; a restless, childless couple, a searching, homeless woman; and an unforgettable, recurring characterâ€”a steely and conflicted wife and mother. The stories in this collection span characters, towns, decades, even centuries, but Floridaâ€”its landscape, climate, history, and state of mindâ€”becomes its gravitational center: an energy, a mood, as much as a place of residence. Groff transports the reader, then jolts us alert with a crackle of wit, a wave of sadness, a flash of cruelty, as she writes about loneliness, rage, family, and the passage of time. With shocking accuracy and effect, she pinpoints the moments and decisions and connections behind human pleasure and pain, hope and despair, love and furyâ€”the moments that make us alive. Startling, precise, and affecting, Florida is a magnificent achievement.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":275,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.79"},"rating_count":7986,"review_count":1273,"genres":"Short Stories|Fiction|Contemporary|Literary Fiction|Audiobook","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1510685620l/36098092.jpg"}

Then, in late morning, a desperate and distraught gunman bursts in and opens fire, taking all inside hostage.After rushing to the scene, Hugh McElroy, a police hostage negotiator, sets up a perimeter and begins making a plan to communicate with the gunman. As his phone vibrates with incoming text messages he glances at it and, to his horror, finds out that his fifteen-year-old daughter, Wren, is inside the clinic.But Wren is not alone. She will share the next and tensest few hours of her young life with a cast of unforgettable characters: A nurse who calms her own panic in order save the life of a wounded woman. A doctor who does his work not in spite of his faith but because of it, and who will find that faith tested as never before.

So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess teachers, journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers.In Factfulness, Professor of International Health and global TED phenomenon Hans Rosling, together with his two long-time collaborators, Anna and Ola, offers a radical new explanation of why this happens. They reveal the ten instincts that distort our perspectiveâ€”from our tendency to divide the world into two camps (usually some version of us and them) to the way we consume media (where fear rules) to how we perceive progress (believing that most things are getting worse).Our problem is that we donâ€™t know what we donâ€™t know, and even our guesses are informed by unconscious and predictable biases.It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think. That doesnâ€™t mean there arenâ€™t real concerns. But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most.Inspiring and revelatory, filled with lively anecdotes and moving stories, Factfulness is an urgent and essential book that will change the way you see the world and empower you to respond to the crises and opportunities of the future.

One of America's most admired writers takes us on a mind-altering journey to the frontiers of human consciousnessWhen LSD was first discovered in the 1940s, it seemed to researchers, scientists and doctors as if the world might be on the cusp of psychological revolution. It promised to shed light on the deep mysteries of consciousness, as well as offer relief to addicts and the mentally ill. But in the 1960s, with the vicious backlash against the counter-culture, all further research was banned. In recent years, however, work has quietly begun again on the amazing potential of LSD, psilocybin and DMT. Could these drugs in fact improve the lives of many people? Diving deep into this extraordinary world and putting himself forward as a guinea-pig, Michael Pollan has written a remarkable history of psychedelics and a compelling portrait of the new generation of scientists fascinated by the implications of these drugs. How to Change Your Mind is a report from what could very well be the future of human consciousness.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":480,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.33"},"rating_count":10073,"review_count":1356,"genres":"Nonfiction|Science|Psychology|Health|Philosophy","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1545030338l/36613747.jpg"}

He's been circling Kimberly and her conspirators for months, waiting for the right avenue to the truth, and has finally found it. He knows, as strongly as he's known anything, that Kimberly's storyâ€”a grisly, harrowing story of a hit and run fueled by dope and cheap beer that becomes a brutal stabbing in cold bloodâ€”is how it happened.

Seven-year-old Chula and her older sister Cassandra enjoy carefree lives thanks to this protective bubble, but the threat of kidnappings, car bombs, and assassinations hover just outside the neighborhood walls, where the godlike drug lord Pablo Escobar continues to elude authorities and capture the attention of the nation.When their mother hires Petrona, a live-in-maid from the city's guerrilla-occupied slum, Chula makes it her mission to understand Petrona's mysterious ways. But Petrona's unusual behavior belies more than shyness. She is a young woman crumbling under the burden of providing for her family as the rip tide of first love pulls her in the opposite direction. As both girls' families scramble to maintain stability amidst the rapidly escalating conflict, Petrona and Chula find themselves entangled in a web of secrecy that will force them both to choose between sacrifice and betrayal. Inspired by the author's own life, and told through the alternating perspectives of the willful Chula and the achingly hopeful Petrona, Fruit of the Drunken Tree contrasts two very different, but inextricable coming-of-age stories. In lush prose, Rojas Contreras sheds light on the impossible choices women are often forced to make in the face of violence and the unexpected connections that can blossom out of desperation.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":304,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.96"},"rating_count":3548,"review_count":625,"genres":"Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Historical|Literary Fiction","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511284543l/36636727.jpg"}

Itâ€™s a title Kate Brighton inherited from her father after he tried to assassinate the high king years ago. Now Kate lives as an outcast, clinging to the fringes of society as a member of the Relay, the imperial courier service. Only those most skilled in riding and bow hunting ride for the Relay; and only the fastest survive, for when dark falls, the nightdrakesâ€”deadly flightless dragonsâ€”come out to hunt. Fortunately, Kate has a secret edge: she is a wilder, born with magic that allows her to influence the minds of animals. But itâ€™s this magic that she needs to keep hidden, as being a wilder is forbidden, punishable by death or exile. And itâ€™s this magic that leads her to a caravan massacred by nightdrakes in broad daylightâ€”the only survivor her childhood friend, her first love, the boy she swore to forget, the boy who broke her heart.The high kingâ€™s second son, Corwin Tormane, never asked to lead. Even as he waits for the urorâ€”the once-in-a-generation ritual to decide which of the kingâ€™s children will succeed himâ€”he knows itâ€™s always been his brother who will assume the throne. And thatâ€™s fine by him. Heâ€™d rather spend his days away from the palace, away from the sight of his father, broken with sickness from the attempt on his life. But the peacekeeping tour Corwin is on has given him too much time to reflect upon the night he saved his fatherâ€™s lifeâ€”the night he condemned the would-be killer to death and lost the girl he loved. Which is why he takes it on himself to investigate rumors of unrest in one of the remote city-states, only for his caravan to be attackedâ€”and for him to be saved by Kate.With their paths once more entangled, Kate and Corwin have to put the past behind them. The threat of drakes who attack in the daylight is only the beginning of a darker menace stirring in the kingdomâ€”one whose origins have dire implications for Kateâ€™s fatherâ€™s attack upon the king and will thrust them into the middle of a brewing civil war in the kingdom of Rime.","edition":"Unabridged","format":"Audible Audio","pages":0,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.92"},"rating_count":3235,"review_count":647,"genres":"Fantasy|Young Adult|Young Adult|Young Adult Fantasy","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1537905740l/34739766.jpg"}

Ever since she was a child, Jane has longed for a cloistered life as a nun. But her large noble family has other plans, and, as an adult, Jane is invited to the Kingâ€™s court to serve as lady-in-waiting for Queen Katherine of Aragon. The devout Katherine shows kindness to all her ladies, almost like a second mother, which makes rumors of Henryâ€™s lustful pursuit of Anne Boleynâ€”who is also lady-in-waiting to the queenâ€”all the more shocking. For Jane, the betrayal triggers memories of a painful incident that shaped her beliefs about marriage. But once Henry disavows Katherine and secures his new queenâ€”altering the religious landscape of Englandâ€”he turns his eye to another: Jane herself. Urged to return the Kingâ€™s affection and earn favor for her family, Jane is drawn into a dangerous political game that pits her conscience against her desires. Can Jane be the one to give the King his long-sought-after son or will she meet a fate similar to the women who came before her? Bringing new insight to this compelling story, Weir marries meticulous research with gripping historical fiction to re-create the dramas and intrigues of the most renown court in English history.

In the countryâ€™s forgotten pockets, where industry long ago fled, where foreclosures, Walmarts, and opiates riddle the land, death rates for rural whites have skyrocketed, fueled by suicide, addiction and a rampant sense of marginalization and disillusionment. This is the world the characters in Stephen Markleyâ€™s brilliant debut novel, Ohio, inherit. This is New Canaan. On one fateful summer night in 2013, four former classmates converge on the rust belt town where they grew up, each of them with a mission, all of them haunted by regrets, secrets, lost loves. Thereâ€™s Bill Ashcraft, an alcoholic, drug-abusing activist, whose fruitless ambitions have taken him from Cambodia to Zuccotti Park to New Orleans, and now back to 'The Cane' with a mysterious package strapped to the underside of his truck; Stacey Moore, a doctoral candidate reluctantly confronting the mother of her former lover; Dan Eaton, a shy veteran of three tours in Iraq, home for a dinner date with the high school sweetheart heâ€™s tried to forget; and the beautiful, fragile Tina Ross, whose rendezvous with the captain of the football team triggers the novelâ€™s shocking climax.

But for Clara Darden and Virginia Clay, it represents something quite different.For Clara, the terminal is the stepping stone to her future, which she is certain will shine as the brightly as the constellations on the main concourse ceiling. It is 1928, and twenty-five-year-old Clara is teaching at the lauded Grand Central School of Art. A talented illustrator, she has dreams of creating cover art for Vogue, but not even the prestige of the school can override the public's disdain for a 'woman artist.' Brash, fiery, confident, and single-minded--even while juggling the affections of two men, a wealthy would-be poet and a brilliant experimental painter--Clara is determined to achieve every creative success. But she and her bohemian friends have no idea that they'll soon be blindsided by the looming Great Depression, an insatiable monster with the power to destroy the entire art scene. And even poverty and hunger will do little to prepare Clara for the greater tragedy yet to come.Nearly fifty years later, in 1974, the terminal has declined almost as sharply as Virginia Clay's life. Full of grime and danger, from the smoke-blackened ceiling to the pickpockets and drug dealers who roam the floor, Grand Central is at the center of a fierce lawsuit: Is the once-grand building a landmark to be preserved, or a cancer to be demolished? For Virginia, it is simply her last resort. Recently divorced, she has just accepted a job in the information booth in order to support herself and her college-age daughter, Ruby. But when Virginia stumbles upon an abandoned art school within the terminal and discovers a striking watercolor hidden under the dust, her eyes are opened to the elegance beneath the decay. She embarks on a quest to find the artist of the unsigned masterpiece--an impassioned chase that draws Virginia not only into the battle to save Grand Central but deep into the mystery of Clara Darden, the famed 1920s illustrator who disappeared from history in 1931.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":368,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.71"},"rating_count":6996,"review_count":773,"genres":"Historical|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical|Mystery","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1513199542l/37504654.jpg"}

The winds of fortune bring Minnie to Russia, where she marries the Romanov heir and becomes empress once he ascends the throne. When resistance to his reign strikes at the heart of her family and the tsar sets out to crush all who oppose him, Minnie--now called Maria--must tread a perilous path of compromise in a country she has come to love.Her husband's death leaves their son Nicholas as the inexperienced ruler of a deeply divided and crumbling empire. Determined to guide him to reforms that will bring Russia into the modern age, Maria faces implacable opposition from Nicholas's strong-willed wife, Alexandra, whose fervor has lead her into a disturbing relationship with a mystic named Rasputin. As the unstoppable wave of revolution rises anew to engulf Russia, Maria will face her most dangerous challenge and her greatest heartache.From the opulent palaces of St. Petersburg and the intrigue-laced salons of the aristocracy to the World War I battlefields and the bloodied countryside occupied by the Bolsheviks, C.

Harvard professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt have spent more than twenty years studying the breakdown of democracies in Europe and Latin America, and they believe the answer is yes. Democracy no longer ends with a bang--in a revolution or military coup--but with a whimper: the slow, steady weakening of critical institutions, such as the judiciary and the press, and the gradual erosion of long-standing political norms. The good news is that there are several exit ramps on the road to authoritarianism. The bad news is that, by electing Trump, we have already passed the first one.Drawing on decades of research and a wide range of historical and global examples, from 1930s Europe to contemporary Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela, to the American South during Jim Crow, Levitsky and Ziblatt show how democracies die--and how ours can be saved.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":320,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.27"},"rating_count":3999,"review_count":703,"genres":"Politics|Nonfiction|History|Politics|Political Science","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1523290463l/35356384.jpg"}

She knows sheâ€™s spent her whole life in the small beachside town of Belle Isle; she knows sheâ€™s never wanted anything more than to live a quiet life as a pillar of the community; she knows sheâ€™s never kept a secret in her life. Because we all know our mothers, donâ€™t we?But all that changes when a trip to the mall explodes into violence and Andrea suddenly sees a completely different side to Laura. Because it turns out that before Laura was Laura, she was someone completely different. For nearly thirty years sheâ€™s been hiding from her previous identity, lying low in the hope that no one would ever find her. But now sheâ€™s been exposed, and nothing will ever be the same again.The police want answers and Lauraâ€™s innocence is on the line, but she wonâ€™t speak to anyone, including her own daughter. Andrea is on a desperate journey following the breadcrumb trail of her motherâ€™s past. And if she canâ€™t uncover the secrets hidden there, there may be no future for either one of them. . . .*****NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR*****I thought you guys might want to know some of my thoughts on my new book, PIECES OF HER. First off, let me say itâ€™s NOT a Will and Sara book (that will be next year). I hope that youâ€™ll give this one a try even if youâ€™re a series fan. Iâ€™ve been writing about father/daughter relationships a lot in my standalones, but when the plot of PIECES OF HER started taking shape in my brain, I found myself thinking about how much I enjoyed writing scenes in the Grant County series between Sara and her mother . Mother/daughter relationships tend to be more fraught than father/daughter ones, and itâ€™s always fun to play with those tensions. Primarily, I wanted to focus on the opportunities for women now vs. the limited choices when I was growing up. Laura Oliver is older than me, but she was faced with the same messages that I grew up with. No one was telling me I could be a doctor or lawyerâ€”us girls were either fast tracked into nursing, teaching, or library sciences. Title IX was just reaching Morrow High School and I vividly recall being told again and again that girls werenâ€™t interested in sports, or that girls werenâ€™t good at math and science and all those other lies that young women are told about themselves. In contrast to this experience is Laura's 31 year old daughter, Andrea (Andy), who has so many choices that she is paralyzed. I think in many ways 31 year olds are closer to my generationâ€™s 21 year olds. There is no stigma to living with your parents or even hanging out with them. All of the things that for better or worse furiously propelled my generation into adulthoodâ€”getting your own car, having your own apartment, making your own decisions, paying for your stupid mistakesâ€”have ceased being motivating factors.I think a lot of readers can relate to this dynamic, whether they are on the mother side or the daughter side. Everywhere Iâ€™ve traveled, thereâ€™s some phrase in the popular culture that describes what we in the US call a 'helicopter parent.' (In Denmark, theyâ€™re 'curling parents'). Laura has done her level best to make Andyâ€™s life easy and conflict-free, and the end result is that Andy is teetering on the precipice of adulthood, unable to take the leap and with no one around to give her a gentle shove.But donâ€™t worry about all this character stuff. Those of you looking for a thriller should be very satisfied with the story. It opens (as all of my books do) with something really horrible happening. Andy is having a birthday celebration with her mother when suddenly, shit goes sideways. In a flash of violence, Andy sees Laura as not the gentle, loving mother she grew up with but as a complete stranger who is capable of doing terrible things. This leads Andy into a dark placeâ€”and also into a quest to find out who her mother really is. Most kids can relate to not really knowing their parents (and some kids donâ€™t want to know!) but Lauraâ€™s secrets are deadly, which Andy quickly finds out when she starts to put together all the pieces of a woman she has never known.","edition":"","format":"ebook","pages":480,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.81"},"rating_count":13964,"review_count":1938,"genres":"Thriller|Mystery|Fiction|Thriller|Mystery Thriller|Mystery|Crime","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1523035426l/35887251.jpg"}

In a world where women were silenced, she found her voice.From New York Times bestselling author Patti Callahan comes an exquisite novel of Joy Davidman, the woman C. S. Lewis called 'my whole world.' When poet and writer Joy Davidman began writing letters to C. S. Lewisâ€”known as Jackâ€”she was looking for spiritual answers, not love. Love, after all, wasnâ€™t holding together her crumbling marriage. Everything about New Yorker Joy seemed ill-matched for an Oxford don and the beloved writer of Narnia, yet their minds bonded over their letters. Embarking on the adventure of her life, Joy traveled from America to England and back again, facing heartbreak and poverty, discovering friendship and faith, and against all odds, finding a love that even the threat of death couldnâ€™t destroy.In this masterful exploration of one of the greatest love stories of modern times, we meet a brilliant writer, a fiercely independent mother, and a passionate woman who changed the life of this respected author and inspired books that still enchant us and change us. Joy lived at a time when women werenâ€™t meant to have a voiceâ€”and yet her love for Jack gave them both voices they didnâ€™t know they had.At once a fascinating historical novel and a glimpse into a writerâ€™s life, Becoming Mrs. Lewis is above all a love storyâ€”a love of literature and ideas and a love between a husband and wife that, in the end, was not impossible at all.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":432,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.94"},"rating_count":2117,"review_count":439,"genres":"Historical|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical|Romance","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1520907629l/39189837.jpg"}

Eighteen-year-old Robert Weekes is a practitioner of empirical philosophyâ€”an arcane, female-dominated branch of science used to summon the wind, shape clouds of smoke, heal the injured, and even fly. Though he dreams of fighting in the Great War as the first male in the elite US Sigilry Corps Rescue and Evacuation Serviceâ€”a team of flying medicsâ€”Robert is resigned to mixing batches of philosophical chemicals and keeping the books for the family business in rural Montana, where his mother, a former soldier and vigilante, aids the locals.When a deadly accident puts his philosophical abilities to the test, Robert rises to the occasion and wins a scholarship to study at Radcliffe College, an all-womenâ€™s school. At Radcliffe, Robert hones his skills and strives to win the respect of his classmates, a host of formidable, unruly women. Robert falls hard for Danielle Hardin, a disillusioned young war hero turned political radical. However, Danielleâ€™s activism and Robertâ€™s recklessness attract the attention of the same fanatical anti-philosophical group that Robertâ€™s mother fought years before. With their lives in mounting danger, Robert and Danielle band together with a team of unlikely heroes to fight for Robertâ€™s place among the next generation of empirical philosophersâ€”and for philosophyâ€™s very survival against the men who would destroy it.In the tradition of Lev Grossman and Deborah Harkness, Tom Miller writes with unrivaled imagination, ambition, and humor. The Philosopherâ€™s Flight is both a fantastical reimagining of American history and a beautifully composed coming-of-age tale for anyone who has ever felt like an outsider.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":422,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.90"},"rating_count":2775,"review_count":585,"genres":"Fantasy|Historical|Historical Fiction|Fiction","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1501539028l/32620364.jpg"}

The only problem is she isnâ€™t particularly athletic, to put it mildly, and in order to be fit for the field, she has to learn how to run and swim for miles, jump out of a plane, shoot a gun...or else be out of a job.Team leader Levi, call sign Ace, doesnâ€™t have much confidence in Jinaâ€”who he dubbed Babe as soon as he heard her raspy, sexy voiceâ€”making it through the rigors of training. The last thing he needs is some tech geek holding them back from completing a dangerous, covert operation. In the following months, however, no one is more surprised than he when Babe, who hates to sweat, begins to thrive in her new environment, displaying a grit and courage that wins her the admiration of her hardened, battle-worn teammates. Whatâ€™s even more surprising is that the usually very disciplined GO-team leader canâ€™t stop thinking about kissing her smart, stubborn mouthâ€¦or the building chemistry and tension between them.Meanwhile, a powerful Congresswoman is working behind the scenes to destroy the GO-teams, and a trap is set to ambush Leviâ€™s squad in Syria.

Thought dead by her comrades, Jina escapes to the desert where, brutally tested beyond measure, she has to figure out how to stay undetected by the enemy and make it to her crew in time before theyâ€™re exfiltrated out of the country.But Levi never leaves a soldier behind, especially the brave woman heâ€™s fallen for.

Johnson","description":"A rollicking true-crime adventure and a thought-provoking exploration of the human drive to possess natural beauty for readers of The Stranger in the Woods, The Lost City of Z, and The Orchid Thief.On a cool June evening in 2009, after performing a concert at Londonâ€™s Royal Academy of Music, twenty-year-old American flautist Edwin Rist boarded a train for a suburban outpost of the British Museum of Natural History. Home to one of the largest ornithological collections in the world, the Tring museum was full of rare bird specimens whose gorgeous feathers were worth staggering amounts of money to the men who shared Edwinâ€™s obsession: the Victorian art of salmon fly-tying. Once inside the museum, the champion fly-tier grabbed hundreds of bird skinsâ€“some collected 150 years earlier by a contemporary of Darwinâ€™s, Alfred Russel Wallace, whoâ€™d risked everything to gather themâ€“and escaped into the darkness.Two years later, Kirk Wallace Johnson was waist high in a river in northern New Mexico when his fly-fishing guide told him about the heist. He was soon consumed by the strange case of the feather thief. What would possess a person to steal dead birds? Had Edwin paid the price for his crime? What became of the missing skins? In his search for answers, Johnson was catapulted into a years-long, worldwide investigation. The gripping story of a bizarre and shocking crime, and one manâ€™s relentless pursuit of justice, The Feather Thief is also a fascinating exploration of obsession, and manâ€™s destructive instinct to harvest the beauty of nature.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":320,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.05"},"rating_count":4418,"review_count":748,"genres":"Nonfiction|Crime|True Crime|History|Science|Mystery|Crime|Mystery","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1501696324l/35901186.jpg"}

Having survived a profoundly dysfunctional upbringing only to find herself hospitalized and facing a dual diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder and bipolar II disorder; Terese Marie Mailhot is given a notebook and begins to write her way out of trauma. The triumphant result is Heart Berries, a memorial for Mailhot's mother, a social worker and activist who had a thing for prisoners; a story of reconciliation with her fatherâ€•an abusive drunk and a brilliant artistâ€•who was murdered under mysterious circumstances; and an elegy on how difficult it is to love someone while dragging the long shadows of shame.Mailhot trusts the reader to understand that memory isn't exact, but melded to imagination, pain, and what we can bring ourselves to accept. Her unique and at times unsettling voice graphically illustrates her mental state. As she writes, she discovers her own true voice, seizes control of her story, and, in so doing, reestablishes her connection to her family, to her people, and to her place in the world.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":143,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.91"},"rating_count":7728,"review_count":1277,"genres":"Autobiography|Memoir|Nonfiction|Feminism|Biography","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1521733690l/35840657.jpg"}

She contributes regularly to The New Yorker and the New York Review of Books on a range of subjects, and each piece of hers is a literary event in its own right.Arranged into five sectionsâ€”In the World, In the Audience, In the Gallery, On the Bookshelf, and Feel Freeâ€”this new collection poses questions we immediately recognize. What is The Social Network, and Facebook itself, really about? 'It's a cruel portrait of us: 500 million sentient people entrapped in the recent careless thoughts of a Harvard sophomore.' Why do we love libraries? 'Well-run libraries are filled with people because what a good library offers cannot be easily found elsewhere: an indoor public space in which you do not have to buy anything in order to stay.' What will we tell our granddaughters about our collective failure to address global warming? 'So I might say to her, look: the thing you have to appreciate is that we'd just been through a century of relativism and deconstruction, in which we were informed that most of our fondest-held principles were either uncertain or simple wishful thinking, and in many areas of our lives we had already been asked to accept that nothing is essential and everything changes and this had taken the fight out of us somewhat.'Gathering in one place for the first time previously unpublished work, as well as already classic essays, such as, Joy, and, Find Your Beach, Feel Free offers a survey of important recent events in culture and politics, as well as Smith's own life. Equally at home in the world of good books and bad politics, Brooklyn-born rappers and the work of Swiss novelists, she is by turns wry, heartfelt, indignant, and incisive and never any less than perfect company. This is literary journalism at its zenith.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":448,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.81"},"rating_count":2358,"review_count":400,"genres":"Writing|Essays|Nonfiction|Short Stories","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1499085125l/35581653.jpg"}

Rye Mallett, a fearless 'freight dog' pilot charged with flying cargo to far-flung locations, is often rough-spoken, usually unshaven, and he never gets the regulation eight hours of shut-eye before a flight; but he does have a rock-solid reputation: he will fly in the foulest weather, day or night, and deliver the goods safely to their destination. So, when Rye is asked to fly into a completely fogbound Northern Georgia town and deliver a mysterious black box to a Dr. Lambert, he doesn't ask why--he just ups his price. As Rye's plane nears the isolated landing strip, more trouble than inclement weather awaits him. He is greeted first by a sabotage attempt that causes him to crash land, and then by Dr. Brynn O'Neal, who claims she was sent for the box in Dr. Lambert's stead. Despite Rye's 'no-involvement' policy when it comes other people's problems, he finds himself irresistibly drawn to the intrigue surrounding his cargo...and to the mysterious and attractive Brynn O'Neal.  Soon Rye and Brynn are in a treacherous 48-hour race to deliver the box before time runs out. With the hours slipping by and everyone from law enforcement officials to hired thugs hot on their heels, the two must protect their valuable cargo from those who would kill for it--that is, if they can trust each other.

Evans","description":"The history of technology you probably know is one of men and machines, garages and riches, alpha nerds and brogrammers. But the little-known fact is that female visionaries have always been at the vanguard of technology and innovation--they've just been erased from the story. Until now.Women are not ancillary to the history of technology; they turn up at the very beginning of every important wave. But they've often been hidden in plain sight, their inventions and contributions touching our lives in ways we don't even realize.VICE reporter and YACHT lead singer Claire L. Evans finally gives these unsung female heroes their due with her insightful social history of the Broad Band, the women who made the internet what it is today. Learn from Ada Lovelace, the tortured, imaginative daughter of Lord Byron, who wove numbers into the first program for a mechanical computer in 1842. Seek inspiration from Grace Hopper, the tenacious mathematician who democratized computing by leading the charge for machine-independent programming languages after World War II. Meet Elizabeth 'Jake' Feinler, the one-woman Google who kept the earliest version of the Internet online, and Stacy Horn, who ran one of the first-ever social networks on a shoestring out of her New York City apartment in the 1980s. Evans shows us how these women built and colored the technologies we can't imagine life without.Join the ranks of the pioneers who defied social convention and the longest odds to become database poets, information-wranglers, hypertext dreamers, and glass ceiling-shattering dot com-era entrepreneurs. This inspiring call to action is a revelation: women have embraced technology from the start. It shines a light on the bright minds whom history forgot, and shows us how they will continue to shape our world in ways we can no longer ignore.Welcome to the Broad Band.

A short, powerful, illustrated book written by beloved novelist Khaled Hosseini in response to the current refugee crisis, Sea Prayer is composed in the form of a letter, from a father to his son, on the eve of their journey. Watching over his sleeping son, the father reflects on the dangerous sea-crossing that lies before them. It is also a vivid portrait of their life in Homs, Syria, before the war, and of that city's swift transformation from a home into a deadly war zone.  Impelled to write this story by the haunting image of young Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed upon the beach in Turkey in September 2015, Hosseini hopes to pay tribute to the millions of families, like Kurdi's, who have been splintered and forced from home by war and persecution, and he will donate author proceeds from this book to the UNHCR (the UN Refugee Agency) and The Khaled Hosseini Foundation to help fund lifesaving relief efforts to help refugees around the globe.  Khaled Hosseini is one of the most widely read writers in the world, with more than fifty-five million copies of his novels sold worldwide in more than seventy countries.

A magnificent, mind-blowing start to a series Iâ€™m hungry for.'â€” Amal El-Mohtar, New York Times Book Review-In a city that runs on industrialized magic, a secret war will be fought to overwrite reality itself--the first in a dazzling new series from City of Stairs authorÂ Robert Jackson Bennett.  Â  Sancia Grado is a thief, and a damn good one. And her latest target, a heavily guarded warehouse on Tevanneâ€™s docks, is nothing her unique abilities canâ€™t handle.  Â  But unbeknownst to her, Sanciaâ€™s been sent to steal an artifact of unimaginable power, an object that could revolutionize the magical technology known as scriving. The Merchant Houses who control this magic--the art of using coded commands to imbue everyday objects with sentience--have already used it to transform Tevanne into a vast, remorseless capitalist machine. But if they can unlock the artifactâ€™s secrets, they will rewrite the world itself to suit their aims.  Â  Now someone in those Houses wants Sancia dead, and the artifact for themselves. And in the city of Tevanne, thereâ€™s nobody with the power to stop them.  Â  To have a chance at survivingâ€”and at stopping the deadly transformation thatâ€™s under wayâ€”Sancia will have to marshal unlikely allies, learn to harness the artifactâ€™s power for herself, and undergo her own transformation, one that will turn her into something she could never have imagined.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":512,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.32"},"rating_count":4061,"review_count":945,"genres":"Fantasy|Fiction|Adult","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1520460880l/37173847.jpg"}

He often came across as a man possessed, holding forth on culture and politics while mixing in personal revelations â€“ all with mercurial, tongue-twisting intensity as he inhabited and shed one character after another with lightning speed.But as Dave Itzkoff shows in this revelatory biography, Williamsâ€™s comic brilliance masked a deep well of conflicting emotions and self-doubt, which he drew upon in his comedy and in celebrated films like Dead Poets Society; Good Morning, Vietnam; The Fisher King; Aladdin; and Mrs. Doubtfire, where he showcased his limitless gift for improvisation to bring to life a wide range of characters. And in Good Will Hunting he gave an intense and controlled performance that revealed the true range of his talent.Itzkoff also shows how Williams struggled mightily with addiction and depression â€“ topics he discussed openly while performing and during interviews â€“ and with a debilitating condition at the end of his life that affected him in ways his fans never knew. Drawing on more than a hundred original interviews with family, friends, and colleagues, as well as extensive archival research, Robin is a fresh and original look at a man whose work touched so many lives.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":544,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.20"},"rating_count":3884,"review_count":707,"genres":"Biography|Nonfiction|Audiobook|Biography Memoir","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1510882564l/36609155.jpg"}

He was toldâ€”like his entire generationâ€”that his problem was caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. As an adult, trained in the social sciences, he began to investigate this questionâ€”and he learned that almost everything we have been told about depression and anxiety is wrong.

They lead to solutions radically different from the ones we have been offered up until now.Just as Chasing the Scream transformed the global debate about addiction, with over twenty million views for his TED talk and the animation based on it, Lost Connections will lead us to a very different debate about depression and anxietyâ€”one that shows how, together, we can end this epidemic.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":322,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.30"},"rating_count":4789,"review_count":724,"genres":"Nonfiction|Psychology|Self Help|Health|Mental Health|Science|Health","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1500785858l/34921573.jpg"}

What if the cost of saving them is your soul? Would you pay it? I thought I was prepared for what was coming; that if I made sacrifices, I could win this game.  Iâ€™m no longer afraid of the darkness or the monsters that hide in the shadows. Iâ€™ve become what I feared most, allowing it in to protect those I loved. Sometimes it takes a monster to win. Sometimes to fight monsters, you have to become one. My only fear isâ€¦can I come back from it? Warning: 18 and older About the hero: chances are you may not fall instantly in love with him, thatâ€™s because I donâ€™t write men you instantly love; you grow to love them. I donâ€™t believe in instant-love. I write flawed, raw, caveman-like assholes that eventually let you see their redeeming qualities. They are aggressive, assholes, one step above a caveman when we meet them. You may not even like him by the time you finish this book, but I promise you will love him by the end of this series. About the heroine: There is a chance, that you might think sheâ€™s a bit naÃ¯ve, or weak, but then again who starts out as a badass? Badasses are a product of growth and I am going to put her through hell, and you get to watch her come up swinging every time I knock her on her ass. Thatâ€™s just how I do things. How she reacts to the set of circumstances she is put through, may not be how you as the reader, or I as the author would react to that same situation. Everyone reacts differently to circumstances and how Magdalena responds to her challenges, is how I see her as a character and as a person. I donâ€™t write love stories: I write fast paced, knock you on your ass, make you sit on the edge of your seat wondering what happens next books. If youâ€™re looking for cookie cutter romance, this isnâ€™t for you. If you canâ€™t handle the ride, un-buckle your seatbelt and get out of the roller-coaster car now. If not, youâ€™ve been warned.

Albright","description":"A personal and urgent examination of Fascism in the twentieth century and how its legacy shapes todayâ€™s world, written by one of Americaâ€™s most admired public servants, the first woman to serve as U.S. secretary of stateA Fascist, observes Madeleine Albright, 'is someone who claims to speak for a whole nation or group, is utterly unconcerned with the rights of others, and is willing to use violence and whatever other means are necessary to achieve the goals he or she might have.'Â The twentieth century was defined by the clash between democracy and Fascism, a struggle that created uncertainty about the survival of human freedom and left millions dead. Given the horrors of that experience, one might expect the world to reject the spiritual successors to Hitler and Mussolini should they arise in our era. In Fascism: A Warning, Madeleine Albright draws on her experiences as a child in war-torn Europe and her distinguished career as a diplomat to question that assumption.Fascism, as she shows, not only endured through the twentieth century but now presents a more virulent threat to peace and justice than at any time since the end of World War II.Â  The momentum toward democracy that swept the world when the Berlin Wall fell has gone into reverse.Â  The United States, whichÂ historically championed the free world, is led by a president who exacerbates division and heaps scorn on democratic institutions.Â  In many countries, economic, technological, and cultural factors are weakening the political center and empowering the extremes of right and left.Â  Contemporary leaders such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un are employing many of the tactics used by Fascists in the 1920s and 30s.Fascism: A Warning is a book for our times that is relevant to all times.Â  Written Â by someone who has not only studied history but helped to shape it, this call to arms teaches us the lessons we must understand and the questions we must answer if we are to save ourselves from repeating the tragic errors of the past.","edition":"","format":"ebook","pages":304,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.34"},"rating_count":5829,"review_count":1034,"genres":"Nonfiction|Politics|History|Audiobook","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1513524068l/35230469.jpg"}

It's Even Worse Than You Think: What the Trump Administration Is Doing to America tells readers exactly how it is making America worse again.Bestselling author and longtime Trump observer David Cay Johnston shines a light on the political termites who have infested our government under the Trump Administration, destroying it from within and compromising our jobs, safety, finances, and more.No journalist knows Donald Trump better than David Cay Johnston, who has been following him since 1988. It's Even Worse Than You Think: What the Trump Administration Is Doing to America goes inside the administration to show how the federal agencies that touch the lives of all Americans are being undermined. Here is just some of what you will learn:The Wall. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto told President Trump that Mexico will never pay for the border wall. So, Trump is proposing putting a tariff on Mexican imports. But a tariff will simply raise the price of Mexican goods in the US, meaning American consumers will end up paying for the wallâ€”if it ever gets built.Climate Change. Welcome to the new EPA, run by Scott Pruitt, a lawyer who has spent much of his career trying to destroy the agency he now heads. Secrecy reigns at the new EPA because Pruitt meets with industry executives to find out which clean air and clean water provisions they most want to roll back, and keeps staffers in the dark to make sure these pro-pollution plans donâ€™t leak prematurely.Stocking the Swamp. Contrary to his promise to 'drain the swamp' in Washington, DC, Trump has filled his cabinet with millionaires and billionaires, from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a Goldman Sachs and hedge fund veteran who made much of his fortune foreclosing on homeowners to billionaire heiress Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has already put the interests of bankers ahead of debt-burdened students and their families.The Kleptocracy. Under Donald Trump conflict of interest is passÃ©. When Trump isnâ€™t in Washington, he stays at one of his properties, where the taxpayers pick up the tab for staffers, Secret Service, and so on, all at full price. And back in Washington, everyone now knows that the Trump International Hotel is the only place to stay if you want to do business with the administration. Meanwhile sons Donald Jr. and Eric run an eyes-wide-open blind trust of Trump holdings to avoid the appearance of conflict of interestâ€”but not the reality.","edition":"","format":"ebook","pages":320,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.13"},"rating_count":1040,"review_count":203,"genres":"Politics|Nonfiction|History","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511693494l/36101074.jpg"}

Of the millions of men, women, and children transported from Africa to America as slaves, Cudjo was then the only person alive to tell the story of this integral part of the nation's history. Hurston was there to record Cudjo's firsthand account of the raid that led to his capture and bondage fifty years after the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed in the United States.In 1931, Hurston returned to Plateau, the African-centric community three miles from Mobile founded by Cudjo and other former slaves from his ship. Spending more than three months there, she talked in depth with Cudjo about the details of his life. During those weeks, the young writer and the elderly formerly enslaved man ate peaches and watermelon that grew in the backyard and talked about Cudjo's past--memories from his childhood in Africa, the horrors of being captured and held in a barracoon for selection by American slavers, the harrowing experience of the Middle Passage packed with more than 100 other souls aboard the Clotilda, and the years he spent in slavery until the end of the Civil War.Based on those interviews, featuring Cudjo's unique vernacular, and written from Hurston's perspective with the compassion and singular style that have made her one of the preeminent American authors of the twentieth-century, Barracoon masterfully illustrates the tragedy of slavery and of one life forever defined by it. Offering insight into the pernicious legacy that continues to haunt us all, black and white, this poignant and powerful work is an invaluable contribution to our shared history and culture.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":256,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.08"},"rating_count":7574,"review_count":1337,"genres":"Nonfiction|History|Biography|Race|Cultural|Africa|Cultural|African American","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1524663392l/2590136.jpg"}

In 1994, she and her fifteen-year-old sister, Claire, fled the Rwandan massacre and spent the next six years wandering through seven African countries, searching for safety--perpetually hungry, imprisoned and abused, enduring and escaping refugee camps, finding unexpected kindness, witnessing inhuman cruelty. They did not know whether their parents were dead or alive.When Clemantine was twelve, she and her sister were granted asylum in the United States, where she embarked on another journey--to excavate her past and, after years of being made to feel less than human, claim her individuality.Raw, urgent, and bracingly original, The Girl Who Smiled Beads captures the true costs and aftershocks of war: what is forever destroyed; what can be repaired; the fragility of memory; the disorientation that comes of other people seeing you only as broken--thinking you need, and want, to be saved. But it is about more than the brutality of war. It is about owning your experiences, about the life we create: intricately detailed, painful, beautiful, a work in progress.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":288,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.22"},"rating_count":6730,"review_count":1045,"genres":"Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Cultural|Africa|Biography","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1513785011l/36076501.jpg"}

A longtime magazine writer and editor in the food world, she'd returned to her home state of Oregon with her boyfriend from New York City to take an appealing job at a Portland lifestyle magazine. But neither job nor boyfriend delivered on her dreams, and in the span of a year, Davis was unemployed, on her own, with nothing to fall back on. Disillusioned by the years she'd spent mediating the lives of others for a living, she had no idea what to do next. She did know one thing: She no longer wanted to write about the real thing; she wanted to be the real thing.So when a friend told her about Kate Hill, an American woman living in Gascony, France who ran a cooking school and took in strays in exchange for painting fences and making beds, it sounded like just what she needed. She discovered a forgotten credit card that had just enough credit on it to buy a plane ticket and took it as kismet. Upon her arrival, Kate introduced her to the Chapolard brothers, a family of Gascon pig farmers and butchers, who were willing to take Camas under their wing, inviting her to work alongside them in their slaughterhouse and cutting room. In the process, the Chapolards inducted her into their way of life, which prizes pleasure, compassion, community, and authenticity above all else.So begins Camas Davis's funny, heartfelt, searching memoir of her unexpected journey to become a successful and enlightened butcher. It's a story that takes her from an eye-opening stint in rural France where deep artisanal craft and whole animal gastronomy thrives despite the rise of mass scale agribusiness, back to a Portland in the throes of a food revolution, where it suddenly seems possible to translate much of this old-world craft into a new world setting. Camas faces hardships and heartaches along the way, but in the end, Killing It is about what it means to pursue the real thing and to dedicate your life to it.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":352,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.69"},"rating_count":311,"review_count":58,"genres":"Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Food and Drink|Food|Food and Drink|Foodie|Food and Drink|Cooking|Biography","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1515429377l/36856216.jpg"}

Observers declared the end of history, confident in a peaceful, globalized future. But we now know this to be premature. Authoritarianism first returned in Russia, as Putin developed a political system dedicated solely to the consolidation and exercise of power. In the last six years, it has creeped from east to west as nationalism inflames Europe, abetted by Russian propaganda and cyberwarfare. While countries like Poland and Hungary have made hard turns towards authoritarianism, the electoral upsets of 2016 revealed the citizens of the US and UK in revolt against their countries' longstanding policies and values.But this threat to the West also presents an opportunity to better understand the pillars of our own political order. In this forceful and unsparing work of contemporary history, Snyder goes beyond the headlines to expose the true nature of the threat to democracy. By showcasing the stark choices before us--between equality or oligarchy, individuality or totality, truth and falsehood--Snyder restores our understanding of the basis of our way of life, offering a way forward in a time of terrible uncertainty.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":359,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.36"},"rating_count":1300,"review_count":252,"genres":"Politics|History|Nonfiction|Cultural|Russia|North American Hi...|American History","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1519831741l/36217163.jpg"}

To the rest of the world, Nelson Mandela was a giant: an anti-apartheid revolutionary, a world-renowned humanitarian, and South Africa's first black president. To Ndaba Mandela, he was simply 'Granddad.' In Going to the Mountain, Ndaba tells how he came to live with Mandela shortly after he turned eleven--having met each other only once, years before, when Mandela was imprisoned at Victor Verster Prison--and how the two of them slowly, cautiously built a relationship that would affect both their lives in extraordinary ways. It wasn't an easy transition. Mandela had high expectations for those around him, especially his family, and Ndaba chafed at the strict rules and exacting guidelines in his grandfather's home. But at the same time--through overheard calls from foreign dignitaries as well as the Xhosa folk wisdom that his grandfather shared with him at every opportunity--Ndaba was learning how to be a man. On a scale both personal and epic, Ndaba's extraordinary journey mirrors that of South Africa's coming of age--from the segregated Soweto ghettos into which he was born to the privileged life in which he grew up and the turbulent yet exciting times in which he carries on his grandfather's legacy.Going to the Mountain is, in the end, a story about unlocking the power within each of us. It's a cautionary tale about how a child's life can go one way or the other, depending upon the intervention of a caring soul--and about the awesome power of love to serve as a catalyst for change.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":272,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.12"},"rating_count":138,"review_count":22,"genres":"Nonfiction|Biography|History|Autobiography|Memoir","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1524097184l/38139906.jpg"}

They have come together to debate, on behalf of all the women and children in the community, whether to stay or leave before the men return. Taking minutes is the one man trusted and invited by the women to witness the conversation--a former outcast whose own surprising story is revealed as the women speak.By turns poignant, witty, acerbic, bitter, tender, devastating, and heartbreaking, the voices in this extraordinary novel are unforgettable. Toews has chosen to focus the novel tightly on a particular time and place, and yet it contains within its 48 hours and setting inside a hayloft an entire vast universe of thinking and feeling about the experience of women (and therefore men, too) in our contemporary world. In a word: astonishing.","edition":"First Canadian Edition","format":"Hardcover","pages":240,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.78"},"rating_count":2153,"review_count":335,"genres":"Fiction|Feminism|Cultural|Canada|Contemporary|Literary Fiction|Adult Fiction|Religion|Novels|Adult|Womens","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1520888903l/39172103.jpg"}

You smile, say hello. Should be simple, if youâ€™re anyone but me. The first time I met Dylan Reed, I found myself making eye contact with a different part of his body. You see, Iâ€™m very good at being shy, not to mention extremely well-versed in rambling nonsense and, unfortunately, rather highly skilled at making a fool of myself in front of a guy Iâ€™m attracted to. At the time, I knew nothing about him and thought none of what I said would matter since Iâ€™d never speak to him again. Turns out, I was very wrong. He was the star wide receiver of the football team, one of the few players expected to make it into the NFL, and I ended up seeing him all over campus. I might have also propositioned him, run away from him, attacked him with a cooking utensilâ€¦andâ€¦uh, maybe I shouldnâ€™t tell you all of it. Itâ€™s pretty normal stuff, things youâ€™d expectâ€¦from me. Eventually, the time came when I couldnâ€™t hide anymoreâ€”not that heâ€™d have let me even if I tried. Before now, he never knew I was secretly watching him. Now that we see each other every day, he knows when I have a hard time looking away.

Austin Channing Brown's first encounter with a racialized America came at age 7, when she discovered her parents named her Austin to deceive future employers into thinking she was a white man. Growing up in majority-white schools, organizations, and churches, Austin writes, 'I had to learn what it means to love blackness,' a journey that led to a lifetime spent navigating America's racial divide as a writer, speaker and expert who helps organizations practice genuine inclusion.In a time when nearly all institutions (schools, churches, universities, businesses) claim to value 'diversity' in their mission statements, I'm Still Here is a powerful account of how and why our actions so often fall short of our words. Austin writes in breathtaking detail about her journey to self-worth and the pitfalls that kill our attempts at racial justice, in stories that bear witness to the complexity of America's social fabric--from Black Cleveland neighborhoods to private schools in the middle-class suburbs, from prison walls to the boardrooms at majority-white organizations.For readers who have engaged with America's legacy on race through the writing of Ta-Nehisi Coates and Michael Eric Dyson, I'm Still Here is an illuminating look at how white, middle-class, Evangelicalism has participated in an era of rising racial hostility, inviting the reader to confront apathy, recognize God's ongoing work in the world, and discover how blackness--if we let it--can save us all.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":185,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.13"},"rating_count":5620,"review_count":742,"genres":"Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Race|Social Movements|Social Justice","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1510037868l/35883430.jpg"}

As a reckless teen, Bryant let a cowboy kiss him in the barnâ€”a decision with horrifying consequences. Grateful for college and a chance to escape the aftermath of his mistake, Bryant buried himself in his hydrology studies.

You eat fire by eating fire. Two journeysâ€”a daughterâ€™s and a motherâ€™sâ€”bear witness to this lesson in The Electric Woman.For three years Tessa Fontaine lived in a constant state of emergency as her mother battled stroke after stroke. But hospitals, wheelchairs, and loss of language couldnâ€™t hold back such a woman; she and her husband would see Italy together, come what may. Thus Fontaine became free to follow her own piper, a literal giant inviting her to 'come play' in the World of Wonders, Americaâ€™s last traveling sideshow. How could she resist?Transformed into an escape artist, a snake charmer, and a high-voltage Electra, Fontaine witnessed the marvels of carnival life: intense camaraderie and heartbreak, the guilty thrill of hard-earned cash exchanged for a peek into the impossible, and, most marvelous of all, the stories carnival folks tell about themselves. Through these, Fontaine trained her body to ignore fear and learned how to keep her heart open in the face of loss. A story for anyone who has ever imagined running away with the circus, wanted to be someone else, or wanted a loved one to live forever, The Electric Woman is ultimately about death-defying acts of all kinds, especially that ever constant: good old-fashioned unconditional love.","edition":"","format":"Paperback","pages":244,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.95"},"rating_count":606,"review_count":144,"genres":"Autobiography|Memoir|Nonfiction|Biography","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1513074241l/37459167.jpg"}

In one of Rome's historic villas, a party is bright with near-genius, shaded by the socialite patrons of their art. Bear Bavinsky, creator of vast, masculine, meaty canvases, is their god. Larger than life, muscular in both figure and opinion, he blazes at art criticism and burns half his paintings. He is at the centre of the picture. His wife, Natalie, edges out of the shot.From the side of the room watches little Pinch - their son. At five years old he loves Bear almost as much as he fears him. After Bear abandons their family, Pinch will still worship him, striving to live up to the Bavinsky name; while Natalie, a ceramicist, cannot hope to be more than a forgotten muse. Trying to burn brightly under his father's shadow - one of the twentieth century's fiercest and most controversial painters - Pinch's attempts flicker and die. Yet by the end of a career of twists and compromises, Pinch will enact an unexpected rebellion that will leave forever his mark upon the Bear Bavinsky legacy.What makes an artist? In The Italian Teacher, Tom Rachman displays a nuanced understanding of twentieth-century art and its demons, vultures and chimeras. Moreover, in Pinch he achieves a portrait of painful vulnerability and realism: talent made irrelevant by personality. Stripped of egotism, authenticity or genius, Pinch forces us to face the deep held fear of a life lived in vain.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":336,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.61"},"rating_count":3873,"review_count":487,"genres":"Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Art|Cultural|Italy|Literary Fiction","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1503953230l/31937362.jpg"}

Whole Hearts.","authors":"BrenÃ© Brown","description":"In her #1 New York Times bestsellers, BrenÃ© Brown has taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong, and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers, and culture shifters, she's showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead.Leadership is not about titles, status, and wielding power. A leader is anyone who takes responsibility for recognizing the potential in people and ideas, and has the courage to develop that potential.When we dare to lead, we don't pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don't see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it with others. We don't avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it's necessary to do good work.But daring leadership in a culture defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty requires skill-building around traits that are deeply and uniquely human. The irony is that we're choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the exact same time as we're scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines and AI can't do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection, and courage, to start.Four-time #1 New York Times bestselling author BrenÃ© Brown has spent the past two decades studying the emotions and experiences that give meaning to our lives, and the past seven years working with transformative leaders and teams spanning the globe. She found that leaders in organizations ranging from small entrepreneurial startups and family-owned businesses to nonprofits, civic organizations, and Fortune 50 companies all ask the same question:How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders, and how do you embed the value of courage in your culture? In this new book, Brown uses research, stories, and examples to answer these questions in the no-BS style that millions of readers have come to expect and love.Brown writes, 'One of the most important findings of my career is that daring leadership is a collection of skills and practices that are 100 percent teachable. It's learning and unlearning that requires brave work, tough conversations, and showing up with your whole heart. Easy? No. Because choosing courage over comfort is not always our default. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and our work. It's why we're here.'Whether you've read Daring Greatly and Rising Strong or you're new to BrenÃ© Brown's work, this book is for anyone who wants to step up and into brave leadership.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":320,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.12"},"rating_count":3604,"review_count":357,"genres":"Nonfiction|Leadership|Business|Self Help|Psychology|Self Help|Personal Development","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1534047059l/40163165.jpg"}

'And then there was radio silence.' Across all departments, similar stories were playing out: Trump appointees were few and far between; those that did show up were shockingly uninformed about the functions of their new workplace. Some even threw away the briefing books that had been prepared for them.Michael Lewisâ€™s brilliant narrative takes us into the engine rooms of a government under attack by its own leaders. In Agriculture the funding of vital programs like food stamps and school lunches is being slashed. The Commerce Department may not have enough staff to conduct the 2020 Census properly. Over at Energy, where international nuclear risk is managed, itâ€™s not clear there will be enough inspectors to track and locate black market uranium before terrorists do.Willful ignorance plays a role in these looming disasters. If your ambition is to maximize short-term gains without regard to the long-term cost, you are better off not knowing those costs. If you want to preserve your personal immunity to the hard problems, itâ€™s better never to really understand those problems. There is upside to ignorance, and downside to knowledge. Knowledge makes life messier. It makes it a bit more difficult for a person who wishes to shrink the world to a worldview.If there are dangerous fools in this book, there are also heroes, unsung, of course. They are the linchpins of the systemâ€”those public servants whose knowledge, dedication, and proactivity keep the machinery running.

Out of sheer necessity, he developed a method called the Bullet Journal that helped him become consistently focused and effective. When he started sharing his system with friends who faced similar challenges, it went viral. Just a few years later, to his astonishment, Bullet Journaling is a global movement. The Bullet Journal Method is about much more than organizing your notes and to-do lists. It's about what Carroll calls 'intentional living:' weeding out distractions and focusing your time and energy in pursuit of what's truly meaningful, in both your work and your personal life. It's about spending more time with what you care about, by working on fewer things. His new book shows you how to... â€¢ Track the past: Using nothing more than a pen and paper, create a clear and comprehensive record of your thoughts. â€¢ Order the present: Find daily calm by tackling your to-do list in a more mindful, systematic, and productive way. â€¢ Design the future: Transform your vague curiosities into meaningful goals, and then break those goals into manageable action steps that lead to big change. Carroll wrote this book for frustrated list-makers, overwhelmed multitaskers, and creatives who need some structure. Whether you've used a Bullet Journal for years or have never seen one before, The Bullet Journal Method will help you go from passenger to pilot of your own life.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":336,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.98"},"rating_count":1902,"review_count":262,"genres":"Nonfiction|Self Help|Productivity|Self Help|Personal Development|Business|Language|Writing|Reference|Diary|Journaling|How To|Adult","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1528909036l/39071691.jpg"}

The sale would turn out to be one of the most profitable business deals in American history, and the generations that followed enjoyed immense privilege - but they were also haunted by suicides, cancer, alcoholism, and mysterious ailments.More than 100 years after that deal was struck, Allie's mother Mary was diagnosed with the same incurable cancer, a disease that had also claimed her own mother's life. Determined to combat what she had come to consider the 'Jell-O curse' and her looming mortality, Mary began obsessively researching her family's past, determined to understand the origins of her illness and the impact on her life of Jell-O and the traditional American values the company championed. Before she died in 2015, Mary began to send Allie boxes of her research and notes, in the hope that her daughter might write what she could not. JELL-O GIRLS is the liberation of that story.A gripping examination of the dark side of an iconic American product and a moving portrait of the women who lived in the shadow of its fractured fortune, JELL-O GIRLS is a family history, a feminist history, and a story of motherhood, love and loss. In crystalline prose Rowbottom considers the roots of trauma not only in her own family, but in the American psyche as well, ultimately weaving a story that is deeply personal, as well as deeply connected to the collective female experience.","edition":"","format":"Paperback","pages":288,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.15"},"rating_count":1605,"review_count":260,"genres":"Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|History|Biography|Biography Memoir|Audiobook","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511820373l/34096201.jpg"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"6095f2e31eb6a85a10c5aafe"},"book_id":"c1706224","title":"The Reckoning","authors":"John Grisham","description":"October 1946, Clanton, Mississippi Pete Banning was Clanton, Mississippi's favorite son--a decorated World War II hero, the patriarch of a prominent family, a farmer, father, neighbor, and a faithful member of the Methodist church. Then one cool October morning he rose early, drove into town, walked into the church, and calmly shot and killed his pastor and friend, the Reverend Dexter Bell. As if the murder weren't shocking enough, it was even more baffling that Pete's only statement about it--to the sheriff, to his lawyers, to the judge, to the jury, and to his family--was: 'I have nothing to say.' He was not afraid of death and was willing to take his motive to the grave. In a major novel unlike anything he has written before, John Grisham takes us on an incredible journey, from the Jim Crow South to the jungles of the Philippines during World War II; from an insane asylum filled with secrets to the Clanton courtroom where Pete's defense attorney tries desperately to save him.  Reminiscent of the finest tradition of Southern Gothic storytelling, The Reckoning would not be complete without Grisham's signature layers of legal suspense, and he delivers on every page.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":432,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.83"},"rating_count":16360,"review_count":1732,"genres":"Fiction|Mystery|Historical|Historical Fiction|Thriller","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1527031057l/38389488.jpg"}

Although a graduate of the exclusive Foxcroft Academy in Virginia, Miranda has always lived on the margins of high society. When her beautiful mother marries Hugh Fisher, whose summer house on Winthrop overlooks the famous lighthouse, Miranda is catapulted into a heady new world of pedigrees and cocktails, status and swimming pools. Isobel Fisher, Mirandaâ€™s new stepsisterâ€”all long legs and world-weary bravado, engaged to a wealthy Island scionâ€”is eager to draw Miranda into the arcane customs of Winthrop society.But beneath the Islandâ€™s patrician surface, there are really two clansâ€”the summer families with their steadfast ways and quiet obsessions, and the working class of Portuguese fishermen and domestic workers who earn their living on the water and in the laundries of the summer houses. Uneasy among Isobel's privileged friends, Miranda finds herself drawn to Joseph Vargas, whose father keeps the lighthouse with his mysterious wife. In summer, Joseph helps his father in the lobster boats, but in the autumn he returns to Brown University, where he's determined to make something of himself. Since childhood, Joseph has enjoyed an intense, complex friendship with Isobel Fisher, and has a catastrophe that will shatter Winthropâ€™s hard-won tranquility and banish Miranda from the Island for nearly two decades.Now, in the summer of 1969, Miranda returns at last, as a renowned Shakespearean actress hiding a terrible heartbreak. On its surface, the Island remains the sameâ€”determined to keep the outside world from its shores, fiercely loyal to those who belong. But the formerly powerful Fisher family is a shadow of itself, and Joseph Vargas has recently escaped the prison where he was incarcerated for the murder of Mirandaâ€™s stepfather eighteen years earlier. Whatâ€™s more, Miranda herself is no longer a naive teenager, and she begins a fierce, inexorable quest for justice to the man she once lovedâ€”even if it means uncovering every last one of the secrets that bind together the families of Winthrop Island.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":384,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.75"},"rating_count":14542,"review_count":1788,"genres":"Historical|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Mystery|Historical","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1509586304l/36381085.jpg"}

The American experiment rests on three ideasâ€”'these truths,' Jefferson called themâ€”political equality, natural rights, and the sovereignty of the people. And it rests, too, on a fearless dedication to inquiry, Lepore argues, because self-government depends on it. But has the nation, and democracy itself, delivered on that promise?These Truths tells this uniquely American story, beginning in 1492, asking whether the course of events over more than five centuries has proven the nationâ€™s truths, or belied them. To answer that question, Lepore traces the intertwined histories of American politics, law, journalism, and technology, from the colonial town meeting to the nineteenth-century party machine, from talk radio to twenty-first-century Internet polls, from Magna Carta to the Patriot Act, from the printing press to Facebook News.Along the way, Leporeâ€™s sovereign chronicle is filled with arresting sketches of both well-known and lesser-known Americans, from a parade of presidents and a roguesâ€™ gallery of political mischief makers to the intrepid leaders of protest movements, including Frederick Douglass, the famed abolitionist orator; William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate and ultimately tragic populist; Pauli Murray, the visionary civil rights strategist; and Phyllis Schlafly, the uncredited architect of modern conservatism.Americans are descended from slaves and slave owners, from conquerors and the conquered, from immigrants and from people who have fought to end immigration. 'A nation born in contradiction will fight forever over the meaning of its history,' Lepore writes, but engaging in that struggle by studying the past is part of the work of citizenship. 'The past is an inheritance, a gift and a burden,' These Truths observes. 'It canâ€™t be shirked. Thereâ€™s nothing for it but to get to know it.'","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":933,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.44"},"rating_count":517,"review_count":123,"genres":"History|Nonfiction|North American Hi...|American History|Politics","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1520028664l/38212158.jpg"}

What happened would consume the next several years of her life and spur her to investigate the broader role America's culture of fear plays in parenthood. In Small Animals, Brooks asks, Of all the emotions inherent in parenting, is there any more universal or profound than fear? Why have our notions of what it means to be a good parent changed so radically? In what ways do these changes impact the lives of parents, children, and the structure of society at large? And what, in the end, does the rise of fearful parenting tell us about ourselves?Fueled by urgency and the emotional intensity of Brooks's own story, Small Animals is a riveting examination of the ways our culture of competitive, anxious, and judgmental parenting has profoundly altered the experiences of parents and children. In her signature style--by turns funny, penetrating, and always illuminating--which has dazzled millions of fans and been called 'striking' by New York Times Book Review and 'beautiful' by the National Book Critics Circle, Brooks offers a provocative, compelling portrait of parenthood in America and calls us to examine what we most value in our relationships with our children and one another.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":256,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.94"},"rating_count":951,"review_count":205,"genres":"Parenting|Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography Memoir|Family","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1529555915l/35343324.jpg"}

There were many reasons why this composite nation ultimately broke apart, but the fact that enslaved black people repeatedly risked their lives to flee their masters in the South in search of freedom in the North proved that the 'united' states was actually a lie. Fugitive slaves exposed the contradiction between the myth that slavery was a benign institution and the reality that a nation based on the principle of human equality was in fact a prison-house in which millions of Americans had no rights at all. By awakening northerners to the true nature of slavery, and by enraging southerners who demanded the return of their human 'property,' fugitive slaves forced the nation to confront the truth about itself.By 1850, with America on the verge of collapse, Congress reached what it hoped was a solution-- the notorious Compromise of 1850, which required that fugitive slaves be returned to their masters. Like so many political compromises before and since, it was a deal by which white Americans tried to advance their interests at the expense of black Americans. Yet the Fugitive Slave Act, intended to preserve the Union, in fact set the nation on the path to civil war. It divided not only the American nation, but also the hearts and minds of Americans who struggled with the timeless problem of when to submit to an unjust law and when to resist.The fugitive slave story illuminates what brought us to war with ourselves and the terrible legacies of slavery that are with us still.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":464,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.26"},"rating_count":66,"review_count":25,"genres":"History|Nonfiction|North American Hi...|American History|Military History|Civil War|War","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1520612620l/38813232.jpg"}

And how does this seeing change, depending upon what is asked of the viewer? What does it mean when someone states (as one teacher does) that 'you will never be an Artist'â€”who defines 'an Artist,' and all that goes with such an identity, and how are these ideas tied to our shared conceptions of beauty, value, and difference?Old in Art School represents an ongoing exploration of such questions, one that ultimately honors curiosity, openness, and joyâ€”the joy of embracing creativity, dreams, the importance of hard work, and the stubborn determination of your own value. Nell Irvin Painter's journey is filled with surprises, even as she brings to bear the incisiveness of her insights from two careers, which combine in new ways even as they take very different approachesâ€”one searching for facts and cohesion, the other seeking the opposite. She travels from her beloved Newark to the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design; finds meaning in the artists she loves, such as Alice Neel, Faith Ringgold, or Maira Kalman, even as she comes to understand how they are undervalued; and struggles with the ever-changing balance between the pursuit of art and the inevitable, sometimes painful demands of a life fully lived.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":331,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.62"},"rating_count":457,"review_count":97,"genres":"Autobiography|Memoir|Nonfiction|Art|Biography|Biography Memoir|Biography|Autobiography","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1514644970l/37774050.jpg"}

As always both accessible and iconoclastic, Taleb challenges long-held beliefs about the values of those who spearhead military interventions, make financial investments, and propagate religious faiths. Among his insights:â€¢ For social justice,Â focus on symmetry and risk sharing. You cannot make profits and transfer the risks to others, as bankers and large corporations do. You cannot get rich without owning your own risk and paying for your own losses. Forcing skin in the game corrects this asymmetry better than thousands of laws and regulations.â€¢ Ethical rules arenâ€™t universal. Youâ€™re part of a group larger than you, but itâ€™s still smaller than humanity in general.â€¢ Minorities, not majorities, run the world. The world is not run by consensus but by stubborn minorities imposing their tastes and ethics on others.â€¢ You can be an intellectual yet still be an idiot. 'Educated philistines' have been wrong on everything from Stalinism to Iraq to low-carb diets.â€¢ Beware of complicated solutions (that someone was paid to find). A simple barbell can build muscle better than expensive new machines.â€¢ True religion is commitment, not just faith. How much you believe in something is manifested only by what youâ€™re willing to risk for it.The phrase 'skin in the game' is one we have often heard but rarely stopped to truly dissect. It is the backbone of risk management, but itâ€™s also an astonishingly rich worldview that, as Taleb shows in this book, applies to all aspects of our lives. As Taleb says, 'The symmetry of skin in the game is a simple rule thatâ€™s necessary for fairness and justice, and the ultimate BS-buster,' and 'Never trust anyone who doesnâ€™t have skin in the game. Without it, fools and crooks will benefit, and their mistakes will never come back to haunt them.'","edition":"","format":"Paperback","pages":272,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.86"},"rating_count":6455,"review_count":727,"genres":"Nonfiction|Philosophy|Business|Economics|Psychology|Economics|Finance","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1510319798l/36064445.jpg"}

Today, a growing coalition of 'Beaver Believers'â€”including scientists, ranchers, and passionate citizensâ€”recognizes that ecosystems with beavers are far healthier, for humans and non-humans alike, than those without them. From the Nevada deserts to the Scottish highlands, Believers are now hard at work restoring these industrious rodents to their former haunts. Eager is a powerful story about one of the worldâ€™s most influential species, how North America was colonized, how our landscapes have changed over the centuries, and how beavers can help us fight drought, flooding, wildfire, extinction, and the ravages of climate change. Ultimately, itâ€™s about how we can learn to coexist, harmoniously and even beneficially, with our fellow travelers on this planet.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":304,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.24"},"rating_count":176,"review_count":59,"genres":"Nonfiction|Science|Environment|Nature|Animals|Environment|Science|Natural History|History","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1528947839l/40526225.jpg"}

Dopesick is the first book to chart the tragic spread of prescription and street drugs from distressed small communities in Central Appalachia to wealthy suburbs, disparate cities, and once-idyllic farm towns, a trajectory that explains how the crisis persisted for so long and became so entrenched.Beginning with a single dealer who lands in a small Virginia town to work at a chicken-processing plant and sets about turning high school football stars into heroin-overdose statistics, Macy sets out to answer a grieving mother's question -why her only son died - and comes away with a harrowing story of greed and need. From the introduction of OxyContin in 1996, Macy parses how America embraced a medical culture where overtreatment with painkillers became the norm. In some of the same distressed communities featured in her bestselling book Factory Man, the unemployed use painkillers both to numb the pain of joblessness and pay their bills while under-challenged teens across America trade pills in cul-de-sacs, and even high-school standouts fall prey to prostitution, jail, and death. Through unsparing, yet deeply human portraits of the families and first responders struggling to ameliorate the epidemic, each facet of the crisis comes into focus. In these politically fragmented times, Beth Macy shows, perhaps the only thing that unites Americans across geographic and class lines is opioid drug abuse. In a country already unable to provide basic healthcare for all, Dopesick exposes the pioneering spirit necessary for those facing addiction to build better futures for themselves and others.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":384,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.15"},"rating_count":4965,"review_count":822,"genres":"Nonfiction|History|Politics|Science|Health|Health|Medicine","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1517070266l/38217645.jpg"}

From essays on Joan Didion and James Baldwin to Twin Peaks, Britney Spears, and Serial, Bolin illuminates our widespread obsession with women who are abused, killed, and disenfranchised, and whose bodies (dead and alive) are used as props to bolster a manâ€™s story.From chronicling life in Los Angeles to dissecting the 'Dead Girl Show' to analyzing literary witches and werewolves, this collection challenges the narratives we create and tell ourselves, delving into the hazards of toxic masculinity and those of white womanhood. Beginning with the problem of dead women in fiction, it expands to the larger problems of living womenâ€”both the persistent injustices they suffer and the oppression that white women help perpetrate.Sharp, incisive, and revelatory, Dead Girls is a much-needed dialogue on womenâ€™s role in the media and in our culture.","edition":"","format":"ebook","pages":288,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.16"},"rating_count":1346,"review_count":294,"genres":"Nonfiction|Writing|Essays|Feminism|Crime|True Crime","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1515482267l/35180951.jpg"}

There were times when I felt our love in every inch of my body, vibrating, making me feel like it could bring me back to life. The problem was us. The problem is that weâ€™re living in two different worlds now. Fallen Crest and its millionaires for me. Roussou and their criminals for him. I was thriving in mine and he was running his. Butâ€¦But there were nights I felt we couldnâ€™t be further apart than we were, and there were nights I felt we shared the same heartbeat. When was it time? When was it time to either sacrifice, make a change, or walk away from the boy I grew up with?","edition":"1st edition","format":"ebook","pages":0,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.21"},"rating_count":2386,"review_count":313,"genres":"Romance|New Adult|Did Not Finish|Contemporary","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1539277576l/42279088.jpg"}

Richards had an extraordinary girlhood in ultra-conservative Texas, where her hell-raising parentsâ€”her civil rights attorney father and political activist motherâ€”taught their kids to be troublemakers. In the Richards household, the 'dinner table was never for eatingâ€”it was for sorting precinct lists.'She watched her mother, Ann, transform herself from a housewife to a force in American politics who made a name for herself as the straight-talking, truth-telling governor of Texas. But Richards also witnessed the pitfalls of public life that are unique to women, and the constant struggle to protect and expand equal rightsâ€”both exemplified by her marathon congressional testimony, where she held her own against hostile questions for five hours.As a young woman, Richards worked as a labor organizer alongside women earning a minimum wage, and learned that those in power donâ€™t give it up without a fight. Now, after years of advocacy, resistance, and progressive leadership, she shares her story for the first timeâ€”from the joy and heartbreak of activism to the challenges of raising kids, having a life, and making change, all at the same time. She shines a light on the people and lessons that have gotten her through good times and bad, and encourages readers to take risks, make mistakes, and make trouble along the way. Richards has dedicated her life to taking on injustice, and her memoir will inspire readers to hope and action.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":266,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.31"},"rating_count":1918,"review_count":296,"genres":"Nonfiction|Feminism|Autobiography|Memoir|Politics|Audiobook","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1519625345l/35721620.jpg"}

In the year 2018, it seems as if womenâ€™s anger has suddenly erupted into the public conversation. But long before Pantsuit Nation, before the Womenâ€™s March, and before the #MeToo movement, womenâ€™s anger was not only politically catalyticâ€”but politically problematic. The story of female fury and its cultural significance demonstrates the long history of bitter resentment that has enshrouded womenâ€™s slow rise to political power in America, as well as the ways that anger is received when it comes from women as opposed to when it comes from men. With eloquence and fervor, Rebecca tracks the history of female anger as political fuelâ€”from suffragettes marching on the White House to office workers vacating their buildings after Clarence Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Here Traister explores womenâ€™s anger at both men and other women; anger between ideological allies and foes; the varied ways anger is perceived based on its owner; as well as the history of caricaturing and delegitimizing female anger; and the way womenâ€™s collective fury has become transformative political fuelâ€”as is most certainly occurring today. She deconstructs societyâ€™s (and the mediaâ€™s) condemnation of female emotion (notably, rage) and the impact of their resulting repercussions. Highlighting a double standard perpetuated against women by all sexes, and its disastrous, stultifying effect, Traisterâ€™s latest is timely and crucial. It offers a glimpse into the galvanizing force of womenâ€™s collective anger, which, when harnessed, can change history.","edition":"","format":"ebook","pages":320,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.50"},"rating_count":2217,"review_count":409,"genres":"Nonfiction|Feminism|Politics|History|Womens","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1537726614l/39939208.jpg"}

Jahrelang bewahrte die mutige KÃ¶nigstochter der Arrya ihre Erinnerungen fÃ¼r sich. Nun, wÃ¤hrend die Zukunft ungewisser scheint als jemals zuvor, erzÃ¤hlt sie zum ersten Mal von all den Geheimnissen, die sie und ihr geliebter Zwillingsbruder Sinjhar gemeinsam mit ihren Freunden entdeckten. Ihr Erkundungsdrang fÃ¼hrt Tantan zum Grund der Waldseen und in die Gebirge jenseits der Heimat, denn in Erriada ist nur selten etwas so, wie es auf den ersten Blick scheint.

Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as Martin Luther King Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women's rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson's crusade against Jim Crow. Each of these dramatic hours in our national life have been shaped by the contest to lead the country to look forward rather than back, to assert hope over fear â€” a struggle that continues even now.While the American story has not always â€” or even often â€” been heroic, we have been sustained by a belief in progress even in the gloomiest of times. In this inspiring book, Meacham reassures us, 'The good news is that we have come through such darkness before' â€” as, time and again, Lincoln's better angels have found a way to prevail.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":402,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.28"},"rating_count":4324,"review_count":903,"genres":"History|Nonfiction|Politics|North American Hi...|American History","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1521839684l/38525349.jpg"}

Silicon Valley holds extraordinary power over our present lives as well as whatever utopia (or nightmare) might come next.'Â --New York TimesSilicon Valley is a modern utopia where anyone can change the world. Unless you're a woman.For women in tech, Silicon Valley is not a fantasyland of unicorns, virtual reality rainbows, and 3D-printed lollipops, where millions of dollars grow on trees. It's a 'Brotopia,' where men hold all the cards and make all the rules. Vastly outnumbered, women face toxic workplaces rife with discrimination and sexual harassment, where investors take meetings in hot tubs and network at sex parties.In this powerful exposÃ©, Bloomberg TV journalist Emily Chang reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures despite decades of companies claiming the moral high ground (Don't Be Evil! Connect the World!)--and how women are finally starting to speak out and fight back.Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao's high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they 'won't lower their standards' just to hire women. Interviews with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, and former Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer--who got their start at Google, where just one in five engineers is a woman--reveal just how hard it is to crack the Silicon Ceiling. And Chang shows how women such as former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, entrepreneur Niniane Wang, and game developer Brianna Wu, have risked their careers and sometimes their lives to pave a way for other women.Silicon Valley's aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world. It's time to break up the boys' club. Emily Chang shows us how to fix this toxic culture--to bring down Brotopia, once and for all.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":317,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.04"},"rating_count":1994,"review_count":277,"genres":"Nonfiction|Business|Feminism|Science|Technology","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1506133747l/36288143.jpg"}

Abraham Lincoln, who had been involved in more than three thousand cases--including more than twenty-five murder trials--during his two-decades-long career, was hired to defend him. This was to be his last great case as a lawyer.What normally would have been a local case took on momentous meaning. Lincoln's debates with Senator Stephen Douglas the previous fall had gained him a national following, transforming the little-known, self-taught lawyer into a respected politician. He was being urged to make a dark-horse run for the presidency in 1860. Taking this case involved great risk. His reputation was untarnished, but should he lose this trial, should Harrison be convicted of murder, the spotlight now focused so brightly on him might be dimmed. He had won his most recent murder trial with a daring and dramatic maneuver that had become a local legend, but another had ended with his client dangling from the end of a rope.The case posed painful personal challenges for Lincoln. The murder victim had trained for the law in his office, and Lincoln had been his friend and his mentor. His accused killer, the young man Lincoln would defend, was the son of a close friend and loyal supporter. And to win this trial he would have to form an unholy allegiance with a longtime enemy, a revivalist preacher he had twice run against for political office--and who had bitterly slandered Lincoln as an 'infidel...too lacking in faith' to be elected.Lincoln's Last Trial captures the presidential hopeful's dramatic courtroom confrontations in vivid detail as he fights for his client--but also for his own blossoming political future. It is a moment in history that shines a light on our legal system, as in this case Lincoln fought a legal battle that remains incredibly relevant today.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":368,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.93"},"rating_count":1736,"review_count":273,"genres":"History|Nonfiction|Biography|North American Hi...|American History|Crime|True Crime|Historical","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1512348208l/36743867.jpg"}

She was repeatedly hospitalized in excruciating pain, but the doctors insisted it was a urinary tract infection and sent her home with antibiotics. Unable to get out of bed, much less attend class, Norman dropped out of college and embarked on what would become a years-long journey to discover what was wrong with her. It wasn't until she took matters into her own hands--securing a job in a hospital and educating herself over lunchtime reading in the medical library--that she found an accurate diagnosis of endometriosis.In Ask Me About My Uterus, Norman describes what it was like to have her pain dismissed, to be told it was all in her head, only to be taken seriously when she was accompanied by a boyfriend who confirmed that her sexual performance was, indeed, compromised. Putting her own trials into a broader historical, sociocultural, and political context, Norman shows that women's bodies have long been the battleground of a never-ending war for power, control, medical knowledge, and truth. It's time to refute the belief that being a woman is a preexisting condition.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":288,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.95"},"rating_count":809,"review_count":186,"genres":"Nonfiction|Feminism|Autobiography|Memoir|Science|Health|Biography|Womens","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1508438979l/35605474.jpg"}

Offices across the State Department sit empty, while abroad the military-industrial complex has assumed the work once undertaken by peacemakers. Weâ€™re becoming a nation that shoots first and asks questions later.In an astonishing account ranging from Washington, D.C., to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and North Korea in the years since 9/11, acclaimed journalist and former diplomat Ronan Farrow illuminates one of the most consequential and poorly understood changes in American history. His firsthand experience in the State Department affords a personal look at some of the last standard-bearers of traditional statecraft, including Richard Holbrooke, who made peace in Bosnia and died while trying to do so in Afghanistan. Farrowâ€™s narrative is richly informed by interviews with whistleblowers, policymakers, and a warlord, from Henry Kissinger to Hillary Clinton. Diplomacy, Farrow argues, has declined after decades of political cowardice, short-sightedness, and outright maliceâ€”but it may just offer America a way out of a world at war.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":392,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.21"},"rating_count":2767,"review_count":401,"genres":"Politics|Nonfiction|History","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1524076329l/37564532.jpg"}

In EVER REALLY HEAR IT music is an ambient mediator of raced and gendered spaces. The book critiques music's ability to shape culture and the way marginalized bodies experience narrow space while it also honors the desires of women in their own versions of love song. The voices in this book create a mythology foregrounded in close readings of popular music's subtexts across historical consciousness.'Open your ear to Soham Patel's EVER REALLY HEAR IT, and find a twisted lullaby courting you into a phantasmagoric dream caught some place between the chaos of migration and a garden. Patel, in this astonishing accomplishment, engages a poetic of the toughly textured utterance, 'scratched wood scratch metal'--one that speaks into the mouth of what music might be if it were a body with experience. That's how we hear it, like Tina Turner sings in 'Proud Mary, ' 'See we never do nothing / nice, easy / We always do it nice and rough.' A rock riff, a blues for a broken heart, a limp, ever really hear it situates Soham Patel's poems in a breaking-glass lyric, stripping the soul, and stroking it too, in a way we desperately need now.'--Dawn Lundy Martin'Soham Patel writes poems the way I want to be kissed--with fervent challenge, presence, and sensual intelligence. She reminds me that when the instrument breaks, the desire for melody--that longing for a sinuous connection across divides--persists.

And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club","authors":"Nell Scovell","description":"FOREWORD BY SHERYL SANDBERGYouâ€™ve almost certainly laughed at Scovellâ€™s jokesâ€”you just didnâ€™t know it until now.Just the Funny Parts is a juicy and scathingly funny insider look at how pop culture gets made. For more than thirty years, writer, producer and director Nell Scovell worked behind the scenes of iconic TV shows, including The Simpsons, Late Night with David Letterman, Murphy Brown, NCIS, The Muppets, and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, which she created and executive produced. Â In 2009, Scovell gave up her behind-the-scenes status when the David Letterman sex scandal broke. Only the second woman ever to write for his show, Scovell used the moment to publicly call out the lack of gender diversity in late-night TV writersâ€™ rooms. 'One of the boys' came out hard for 'all of the girls.' Her criticisms fueled a cultural debate. Two years later, Scovell was collaborating with Sheryl Sandberg on speeches and later on Lean In, which resulted in a worldwide movement.Now Scovell is opening up with this fun, honest, and often shocking account. Scovell knows what itâ€™s like to put words in the mouths of President Barack Obama, Mark Harmon, Candice Bergen, Bob Newhart, Conan Oâ€™Brien, Alyssa Milano, and Kermit the Frog, among many others. Through her eyes, youâ€™ll sit in the Simpson writersâ€™ roomâ€¦ stand on the Oscar red carpetâ€¦ pin a tail on Miss Piggyâ€¦bond with Star Trekâ€™s Leonard Nimoyâ€¦ and experience a Stephen King-like encounter with Stephen King.Just the Funny Parts is a fast-paced account of a nerdy girl from New England who fought her way to the top of the highly-competitive, male-dominated entertainment field. The book delivers invaluable insights into the creative process and tricks for navigating a difficult workplace. It's part memoir, part how-to, and part survival story. Or, as Scovell puts it, 'Itâ€™s likeÂ Unbroken,Â but funnier and with slightly less torture.'Â ","edition":"","format":"ebook","pages":316,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.01"},"rating_count":1727,"review_count":264,"genres":"Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Humor|Biography|Feminism","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1516967994l/30531540.jpg"}

Like the other families who adhere to this philosophy, Libby's family regards the father as the 'Christian patriarch' and leader and the mother as the 'helpmeet' who gives birth to, cares for, and homeschools the children. Meanwhile, Zo is the gender fluid offspring of Libby's new neighbors who have moved to the country from Knoxville in hopes of living a slower-paced, more natural life. Zo and hir family are as far to the left ideologically as Libby's family is to the right, and yet Libby and Zo, who are the same age, feel a connection that leads them to friendshipâ€”a friendship that seems doomed from the start because of their families' differences.Â Through deft storytelling, built upon extraordinary character development, author Watts offers a close examination of the contemporary compartmentalization of social interactions, and forms a story that resonates far beyond its pages.","edition":"","format":"Paperback","pages":324,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.23"},"rating_count":86,"review_count":27,"genres":"Young Adult|Lgbt|Fiction|Realistic Fiction","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1522824983l/39715234.jpg"}

Gregory Pardlo's father was a brilliant and charismatic man--a leading labor organizer who presided over a happy suburban family of four. But when he loses his job following the famous air traffic controllers' strike of 1981, he succumbs to addiction and exhausts the family's money on more and more ostentatious whims. In the face of this troubling model and disillusioned presence in the household, young Gregory rebels. Struggling to distinguish himself on his own terms, he hustles off to Marine Corps boot camp. He moves across the world, returning to the United States only to take a job as a manager-cum-barfly at his family's jazz club.Air Traffic follows Gregory as he builds a life that honors his history without allowing it to define his future. Slowly, he embraces the challenges of being a poet, a son, and a father as he enters recovery for alcoholism and tends to his family. In this memoir, written in lyrical and sparkling prose, Gregory tries to free himself from the overwhelming expectations of race and class, and from the tempting yet ruinous legacy of American masculinity.Air Traffic is a richly realized, deeply felt ode to one man's remarkable father, to fatherhood, and to the frustrating yet redemptive ties of family.

Chosen for his original perspective and gift with language, his role was to help shape the nationâ€™s hopes and sense of itself. For nearly ten years, Rhodes was at the centre of the Obama Administration â€“ first as a speechwriter, then a policymaker, and finally a multi-purpose aide and close collaborator.Rhodes puts us in the room at the most tense and poignant moments in recent history: starting every morning with Obama in the Daily Briefing; waiting out the bin Laden raid in the Situation Room; reaching a nuclear agreement with Iran; leading secret negotiations with the Cuban government; confronting the resurgence of nationalism that led to the election of Donald Trump.This is the most vivid portrayal yet of Obamaâ€™s presidency. It is an essential record of the last decade. But it also shows us what it means to hold the pen, and to write the words that change our world.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":480,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.32"},"rating_count":3866,"review_count":436,"genres":"Politics|Nonfiction|History|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1528123811l/38458392.jpg"}

Charles Darwin played a crucial part in turning heredity into a scientific question, and yet he failed spectacularly to answer it. The birth of genetics in the early 1900s seemed to do precisely that. Gradually, people translated their old notions about heredity into a language of genes. As the technology for studying genes became cheaper, millions of people ordered genetic tests to link themselves to missing parents, to distant ancestors, to ethnic identities. . . .But, Zimmer writes, 'Each of us carries an amalgam of fragments of DNA, stitched together from some of our many ancestors. Each piece has its own ancestry, traveling a different path back through human history. A particular fragment may sometimes be cause for worry, but most of our DNA influences who we are--our appearance, our height, our penchants--in inconceivably subtle ways.' Heredity isn't just about genes that pass from parent to child. Heredity continues within our own bodies, as a single cell gives rise to trillions of cells that make up our bodies. We say we inherit genes from our ancestors--using a word that once referred to kingdoms and estates--but we inherit other things that matter as much or more to our lives, from microbes to technologies we use to make life more comfortable. We need a new definition of what heredity is and, through Carl Zimmer's lucid exposition and storytelling, this resounding tour de force delivers it. Weaving historical and current scientific research, his own experience with his two daughters, and the kind of original reporting expected of one of the world's best science journalists, Zimmer ultimately unpacks urgent bioethical quandaries arising from new biomedical technologies, but also long-standing presumptions about who we really are and what we can pass on to future generations.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":544,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.18"},"rating_count":857,"review_count":155,"genres":"Science|Nonfiction|Science|Biology|History|Biology|Genetics|Biology|Evolution","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511221974l/36391536.jpg"}

The first section, 'Folly,' tells the story of Alice, a young American editor, and her relationship with the famous and much older writer Ezra Blazer. A tender and exquisite account of an unexpected romance that takes place in New York during the early years of the Iraq War, 'Folly' also suggests an aspiring novelistâ€™s coming-of-age. By contrast, 'Madness' is narrated by Amar, an Iraqi-American man who, on his way to visit his brother in Kurdistan, is detained by immigration officers and spends the last weekend of 2008 in a holding room in Heathrow. These two seemingly disparate stories gain resonance as their perspectives interact and overlap, with yet new implications for their relationship revealed in an unexpected coda.A stunning debut from a rising literary star, Asymmetry is an urgent, important, and truly original work that will captivate any reader while also posing arresting questions about the very nature of fiction itself.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":277,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.59"},"rating_count":6231,"review_count":1078,"genres":"Fiction|Literary Fiction|Novels|Contemporary","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1524238425l/35297339.jpg"}

As a dress designer, few could compare. An ingenious architect, she innovated the use of marble in her parentsâ€™ mausoleum on the banks of the Yamuna River that inspired her stepsonâ€™s Taj Mahal. And she was both celebrated and reviled for her political acumen and diplomatic skill, which rivaled those of her female counterparts in Europe and beyond.In 1611, thirty-four-year-old Nur Jahan, daughter of a Persian noble and widow of a subversive official, became the twentieth and most cherished wife of the Emperor Jahangir. While other wives were secluded behind walls, Nur ruled the vast Mughal Empire alongside her husband, and governed in his stead as his health failed and his attentions wandered from matters of state. An astute politician and devoted partner, Nur led troops into battle to free Jahangir when he was imprisoned by one of his own officers. She signed and issued imperial orders, and coins of the realm bore her name.Acclaimed historian Ruby Lal uncovers the rich life and world of Nur Jahan, rescuing this dazzling figure from patriarchal and Orientalist clichÃ©s of romance and intrigue, and giving new insight into the lives of women and girls in the Mughal Empire, even where scholars claim there are no sources. Nurâ€™s confident assertion of authority and talent is revelatory.

More than a year later, there seemed to be a breakthrough when a small-time crook named Erla Bolladottir described a dream to police that they interpreted as a sign of trauma related to the menâ€™s disappearance. After lengthy interrogations, investigations, and courtroom dramas, Bolladottir and five acquaintances confessed to killing both men and were given prison sentences ranging from three years to life. But over the years the case against the convicted six began to disintegrate, and one major question remained unanswered: Why had they all confessed to murder if they hadnâ€™t done it?Out of Thin Air joins Bolladottir in the present day as she pursues her exoneration, exploring the many facets of this bizarre and bewildering case and the social and cultural history of Iceland, a country of vast landscapes, extreme weather, and strange folklore, where more than eighty per cent of the population believes that elves might exist.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":304,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.50"},"rating_count":200,"review_count":21,"genres":"Nonfiction|Crime|True Crime|Mystery|Crime|Mystery|History","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1520794066l/39110879.jpg"}

Surprised, if not dismayed, to discover from his superior, Vice-Questore Patta, that leaks are emanating from the Questura, Commissario Guido Brunetti is surprised more consequentially by the appearance of a friend of his wifeâ€™s, fearful that her son is using drugs and hopeful Brunetti can somehow intervene. When Tullio Gasparini, the womanâ€™s husband, is found unconscious and with a serious brain injury at the foot of a bridge in Venice after midnight, Brunetti is drawn to pursue a possible connection to the boyâ€™s behavior. But the truth, as Brunetti has experienced so often, is not straightforward.As the twenty-seventh novel unfolds in Donna Leonâ€™s exquisite chronicle of Venetian life in all its blissful and sordid aspects, Brunetti pursues several false and contradictory leads while growing ever more impressed by the intuition of his fellow Commissario, Claudia Griffoni, and by the endless resourcefulness and craftiness of Signorina Elettra, Pattaâ€™s secretary and gate-keeper. Exasperated by the petty bureaucracy that constantly bedevils him and threatens to expose Signorina Elettra, Brunetti is steadied by the embrace of his own family and by his passion for the classics. This predilection leads him to read Sophoclesâ€™ Antigone, and, in its light, consider the terrible consequences to which the actions of a tender heart can lead.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":272,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.91"},"rating_count":3385,"review_count":404,"genres":"Mystery|Fiction|Cultural|Italy|Mystery|Crime","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511792769l/35576032.jpg"}

The novel opens with Russian president Vladimir Putin planning the covert assassination of a high-ranking US official with the intention of replacing him with a mole whom Russian intelligence has cultivated for more than fifteen years.Catching wind of this plot, Dominika, Nate, and their CIA colleagues must unmask the traitor before he or she is able to reveal that Dominika has been spying for years on behalf of the CIA. Any leak, any misstep, will expose her as a CIA asset and result in a one-way trip to a Moscow execution cellar. Along the way, Matthews, a thirty-three-year veteran of the CIA and winner of the Edgar Award for Best First Novel, sets vivid, unforgettable scenes in Moscow; Washington, DC; Hong Kong; New York; the Sudan; and Turkey, and introduces two cold-blooded killers: Iosip Blokhin, a brilliant Spetsnaz military officer, and Grace Gao, ravishing Chinese spy, master of Kundalini yoga, and Beijing-trained seductress.Ultimately, the lines of danger converge on the spectacular billion-dollar presidential palace on the Black Sea during a power weekend with Putinâ€™s inner circle. Does Nate sacrifice himself to save Dominika? Does she forfeit herself to protect Nate? Do they go down together?This dazzling finale to Jason Matthewsâ€™s New York Times bestselling Red Sparrow Trilogy, called 'a primer in twenty-first-century spying...terrifically good' (The New York Times Book Review), confirms the critical acclaim he received for the first two novels, praise that compared Matthews to John le CarrÃ© and Ian Fleming. The Kremlinâ€™s Candidate will be published just before the 2018 release of Red Sparrow, a major motion picture starring Jennifer Lawrence, produced by 20th Century Fox.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":435,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.17"},"rating_count":8290,"review_count":725,"genres":"Fiction|Thriller|Spy Thriller|Espionage|Mystery|Cultural|Russia","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1502043342l/30753713.jpg"}

Heâ€™s gay, but the Chattanooga chapter has accepted gay couples into their social circle, so he hopes they can accept him.Matty is about to graduate college, and heâ€™s in the market for a Daddy. He walks into the RTMC bar with two of his girlfriends, and a huge hulk of a man rescues him from some rednecks. He recognizes the bouncer for the leather daddy he is, and sparks fly between them.Most of the MC is prepared to accept Razor as a gay brother, but they know theyâ€™ll have to figure things out as they happen once Razor is serious about someone. Will his â€˜boyâ€™ be an olâ€™lady? And can all the olâ€™lady rules really apply to a man?Razor is a Raven, Matty is human. The RTMC fits into the local supernatural hierarchy in a myriad of ways, and Razor is already friends with Abbott and Spence. But a supernatural storm is about to blindside the club, and their personal ties to The Dragon King and Master Vampire wonâ€™t be enough to help.This title can be read as a stand-alone.Warning: Male-male sexual practices are front and center in this book, not to mention itâ€™s kinky as your grandmotherâ€™s old phone cord. Razor and Matty are heavy on the D/s, the S&M, and the B&D. Since some reviewers have been surprised by this, it seems necessary to also warn that sometimes bikers solve problems with their fists, and thereâ€™s lots of sexy fun in the clubhouse with women who hang around because they want to be there, and who can leave anytime they want.","edition":"","format":"","pages":329,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.21"},"rating_count":130,"review_count":53,"genres":"Erotica|Bdsm|Romance|M M Romance|Paranormal|Shapeshifters|Fantasy|Paranormal|Shapeshifters|Werewolves","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1520596913l/38488439.jpg"}

'Why wouldnâ€™t seaweeds be a protean life source for the lives that have evolved since?' On a planet facing environmental change and diminishing natural resources, seaweed is increasingly important as a source of food and as a fundamental part of our global ecosystem. In Seaweed Chronicles, Shetterly takes readers deep into the world of this essential organism by providing an immersive, often poetic look at life on the rugged shores of her beloved Gulf of Maine, where the growth and harvesting of seaweed is becoming a major industry. While examining the life cycle of seaweed and its place in the environment, she tells the stories of the men and women who farm and harvest itâ€”and who are fighting to protect this critical species against forces both natural and man-made. Ideal for readers of such books as The Hidden Life of Trees and How to Read Water, Seaweed Chronicles is a deeply informative look at a little understood and too often unappreciated part of our habitat.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":288,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.00"},"rating_count":72,"review_count":22,"genres":"Nonfiction|Science|Environment|Nature|Science|Biology|Environment","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1532868523l/38746164.jpg"}

Was he drunk to boot? He greeted his new assistant with 'What are you drinking?' Yes, he was drunk.Charlie Harmon was hired to manage the day-to-day parts of Bernstein's life. There was one additional responsibility: make sure Bernstein met the deadline for an opera commission. But things kept getting in the way: the centenary of Igor Stravinsky, intestinal parasites picked up in Mexico, teaching all summer in Los Angeles, a baker's dozen of young men, plus depression, exhaustion, insomnia, and cut-throat games of anagrams. Did the opera get written?For four years, Charlie saw Bernstein every day, as his social director, gatekeeper, valet, music copyist, and itinerant orchestra librarian. He packed (and unpacked) Bernstein's umpteen pieces of luggage, got the Maestro to his concerts, kept him occupied changing planes in Zurich, Anchorage, Tokyo, or Madrid, and learned how to make small talk with mayors, ambassadors, a chancellor, a queen, and a Hollywood legend or two. How could anyone absorb all those people and places? Because there was music: late-night piano duets, or the Maestro's command to accompany an audition, or, by the way, the greatest orchestras in the world. Charlie did it, and this is what it was like, told for the first time.A celebratory, intimate, and detailed look at the public and private life of Leonard Bernstein written by his former assistant.

When war arrives, the master of Beauvais, Anthony Levallios, foresees that mastery in a new America will be measured not in acres of tobacco under cultivation by his slaves, but in industry and capital. A grievously wounded Confederate veteran loses his grip on a world he no longer understands, and his daughter finds herself married to Levallois, an arrangement that feels little better than imprisonment. And two people enslaved at Beauvais plantation, Nurse and Rawls, overcome impossible odds to be together, only to find that the promise of coming freedom may not be something they will live to see.Seamlessly interwoven is the story of George Seldom, a man orphaned by the storm of the Civil War, looking back from the 1950s on the void where his childhood ought to have been. Watching the government destroy his neighborhood to build a stretch of the interstate highway system through Richmond, Virginia, and recognizing that his days on earth are coming to an end, he travels south to try to fill in that void. With the help of a young woman, he goes in search of his beginnings, all the while remembering the life that witnessed so much change during the 20th century, and so much that didn't. As the narrative finds that young woman farther in the future, now in her middle age, the questions remain: How do we live in a world built on the suffering of others? And can love exist in a place where for 400 years violence has been the strongest form of intimacy?Written with the same emotional intensity, harrowing realism, and poetic precision that made THE YELLOW BIRDS one of the most celebrated novels of the past decade, A SHOUT IN THE RUINS cements Powers' place in the forefront of American letters and demands that we reckon with the moral weight of our troubling history.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":272,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.67"},"rating_count":659,"review_count":149,"genres":"Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|War|Military History|Civil War|Historical","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1529679294l/40611146.jpg"}

For most of that time, she didn't know why. All of her trips to the ER and her daily anguish, pain, and lethargy only ever resulted in one question: How could any one person be this sick? Several drug addictions, three major hospitalizations, and over $100,000 later, she finally had a diagnosis: late-stage Lyme disease. Sick is Khakpour's arduous, emotional journeyâ€”as a woman, a writer, and a lifelong sufferer of undiagnosed health problemsâ€”through the chronic illness that perpetually left her a victim of anxiety, living a life stymied by an unknown condition.Divided by settings, Khakpour guides the reader through her illness by way of the locations that changed her courseâ€”New York, LA, New Mexico, and Germanyâ€”as she meditates on both the physical and psychological impacts of uncertainty, and the eventual challenge of accepting the diagnosis she had searched for over the course of her adult life. With candor and grace, she examines her subsequent struggles with mental illness, her addiction to the benzodiazepines prescribed by her psychiatrists, and her ever-deteriorating physical health. A story about survival, pain, and transformation, Sick is a candid, illuminating narrative of hope and uncertainty, boldly examining the deep impact of illness on one woman's life.

In Facts and Fears Clapper traces his career through his rise in ranks of the military, the history of several decades of national intelligence operations, the growing threat of cyberattacks, his relationships with presidents and Congress, and the truth about Russia's role in the presidential election. He describes, in the wake of Snowden and WikiLeaks, his efforts to make intelligence more transparent and to push back against the suspicion that Americans' private lives are subject to surveillance. Clapper considers such difficult questions as, is intelligence ethical? Is it moral to use human sources to learn secrets, to intercept communications, to take pictures of closed societies from orbit? What are the limits of what we should be allowed to do? What protections should we give to the private citizens of the world, not to mention our fellow Americans?

In the greatest intelligence operation in the history of the world, Donald Trump was made President of the United States with the assistance of a foreign power. For the first time, The Plot to Destroy Democracy reveals the dramatic story of how blackmail, espionage, assassination, and psychological warfare were used by Vladimir Putin and his spy agencies to steal the 2016 U.S. election--and attempted to bring about the fall of NATO, the European Union, and western democracy. It will show how Russia and its fifth column allies tried to flip the cornerstones of democracy in order to re-engineer the world political order that has kept most of the world free since 1945. Career U.S. Intelligence officer Malcolm Nance will examine how Russia has used cyber warfare, political propaganda, and manipulation of our perception of reality--and will do so again--to weaponize American news, traditional media, social media, and the workings of the internet to attack and break apart democratic institutions from within, and what we can expect to come should we fail to stop their next attack.Nance has utilized top secret Russian-sourced political and hybrid warfare strategy documents to demonstrate the master plan to undermine American institutions that has been in effect from the Cold War to the present day. Based on original research and countless interviews with espionage experts, Nance examines how Putin's recent hacking accomplished a crucial first step for destabilizing the West for Russia, and why Putin is just the man to do it. Nance exposes how Russia has supported the campaigns of right-wing extremists throughout both the U.S. and Europe to leverage an axis of autocracy, and how Putin's agencies have worked since 2010 to bring fringe candidate Donald Trump into elections.Revelatory, insightful, and shocking, The Plot To Destroy Democracy puts a professional spy lens on Putin's plot and unravels it play-by-play. In the end, he provides a better understanding of why Putin's efforts are a serious threat to our national security and global alliances--in much more than one election--and a blistering indictment of Putin's puppet, President Donald J. Trump.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":352,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.29"},"rating_count":542,"review_count":141,"genres":"Politics|Nonfiction|History|Cultural|Russia","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1518824606l/38601454.jpg"}

Given this important mission, world stability rests upon the shoulders of its agents. In his new book, former Secret Service officer Gary Byrne takes readers behind the scenes to understand the agency's history and today's security failings that he believes put Americans at risk The American public knows the stories of Secret Service heroism, but they don't know about the hidden legacy of problems that have plagued the agency ever since its creation.Gary Byrne says that decades of catastrophic public failures, near misses, and bureaucratic and cultural rot threaten to erode this critical organization from the inside out.Today, as it works to protect President Trump, the Secret Service stands at a crossroads, and the time needed to choose the right course is running out. Agents and officers are leaving the Secret Service in droves, or they're being overworked to the point where they lose focus on the job. Management makes decisions based on politics, not the welfare of their employees. Byrne believes that this means danger for the men and women of the Secret Service, danger for the President they protect, and danger for the nation. In this book, he shares what he has witnessed and learned about the Secret Service with the hope that the problems of this most important agency can be fixed before it's too late.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":304,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.41"},"rating_count":191,"review_count":42,"genres":"Nonfiction|History|Politics|Historical|Politics|Presidents|North American Hi...|American History","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1509659934l/34850019.jpg"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"6095f2e31eb6a85a10c5ac01"},"book_id":"c1706329","title":"Carceral Capitalism","authors":"Jackie  Wang","description":"In this collection of essays in Semiotext(e)â€™s Intervention series, Jackie Wang examines the contemporary incarceration techniques that have emerged since the 1990s. The essays illustrate various aspects of the carceral continuum, including the biopolitics of juvenile delinquency, predatory policing, the political economy of fees and fines, cybernetic governance, and algorithmic policing. Included in this volume is Wangâ€™s influential critique of liberal anti-racist politics, 'Against Innocence,' as well as essays on RoboCop, techno-policing, and the aesthetic problem of making invisible forms of power legible.Wang shows that the new racial capitalism begins with parasitic governance and predatory lending that extends credit only to dispossess later. Predatory lending has a decidedly spatial character and exists in many forms, including subprime mortgage loans, student loans for sham for-profit colleges, car loans, rent-to-own scams, payday loans, and bail bond loans. Parasitic governance, Wang argues, operates through five primary techniques: financial states of exception, automation, extraction and looting, confinement, and gratuitous violence. While these techniques of governance often involve physical confinement and the state-sanctioned execution of black Americans, new carceral modes have blurred the distinction between the inside and outside of prison. As technologies of control are perfected, carcerality tends to bleed into society.","edition":"","format":"Paperback","pages":359,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.70"},"rating_count":127,"review_count":16,"genres":"Nonfiction|Politics|Writing|Essays|History|Race|Philosophy|Theory|Academic","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1502389008l/34551009.jpg"}

Soon, the Gestapo closes in, determined to make the shtetele she lives in 'free of Jews.'

Chiversâ€™s unvarnished account of modern combat, told through the eyes of the fighters who have waged Americaâ€™s longest wars.More than 2.7 million Americans have served in Afghanistan or Iraq since September 11, 2001. C.J. Chivers reported from both wars from their beginnings. The Fighters vividly conveys the physical and emotional experience of war as lived by six combatants: a fighter pilot, a corpsman, a scout helicopter pilot, a grunt, an infantry officer, and a Special Forces sergeant.Chivers captures their courage, commitment, sense of purpose, and ultimately their suffering, frustration, and moral confusion as new enemies arise and invasions give way to counterinsurgency duties for which American forces were often not prepared.The Fighters is a tour de force, a portrait of modern warfare that parts from slogans to do for American troops what Stephen Ambrose did for the G.I.s of World War II and Michael Herr for the grunts in Vietnam. Told with the empathy and understanding of an author who is himself an infantry veteran, The Fighters presents the long arc of two wars.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":401,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.41"},"rating_count":401,"review_count":75,"genres":"Nonfiction|History|War|Military Fiction|War|Military|Military History|Politics","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1510884592l/36609294.jpg"}

Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? In this elegant assessment of the human condition in the third millennium, cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing.Far from being a naÃ¯ve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature--tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking--which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation. With intellectual depth and literary flair, Enlightenment Now makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":576,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.24"},"rating_count":7401,"review_count":1110,"genres":"Nonfiction|Science|Philosophy|History|Psychology|Politics","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1502223499l/35696171.jpg"}

Their closest neighbors are more than two miles in either direction along a rutted dirt road.One afternoon, as Wen catches grasshoppers in the front yard, a stranger unexpectedly appears in the driveway. Leonard is the largest man Wen has ever seen but he is young, friendly, and he wins her over almost instantly. Leonard and Wen talk and play until Leonard abruptly apologizes and tells Wen, 'None of whatâ€™s going to happen is your fault'. Three more strangers then arrive at the cabin carrying unidentifiable, menacing objects. As Wen sprints inside to warn her parents, Leonard calls out: 'Your dads wonâ€™t want to let us in, Wen. But they have to. We need your help to save the world.'Thus begins an unbearably tense, gripping tale of paranoia, sacrifice, apocalypse, and survival that escalates to a shattering conclusion, one in which the fate of a loving family and quite possibly all of humanity are entwined. The Cabin at the End of the World is a masterpiece of terror and suspense from the fantastically fertile imagination of Paul Tremblay.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":272,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.37"},"rating_count":11073,"review_count":2213,"genres":"Horror|Fiction|Thriller|Mystery|Suspense|Audiobook|Thriller|Mystery Thriller|Adult|Lgbt|Adult Fiction","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511884752l/36381091.jpg"}

The story of female fury and its cultural significance demonstrates the long history of bitter resentment that has enshrouded womenâ€™s slow rise to political power in America, as well as the ways that anger is received when it comes from women as opposed to when it comes from men.With eloquence and fervor, Rebecca tracks the history of female anger as political fuelâ€”from suffragettes chaining themselves to the White House to office workers vacating their buildings after Clarence Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Here Traister explores womenâ€™s anger at both men and other women; anger between ideological allies and foes; the varied ways anger is perceived based on its owner; as well as the history of caricaturing and delegitimizing female anger; and the way womenâ€™s collective fury has become transformative political fuelâ€”as is most certainly occurring today. She deconstructs societyâ€™s (and the mediaâ€™s) condemnation of female emotion (notably, rage) and the impact of their resulting repercussions.Highlighting a double standard perpetuated against women by all sexes, and its disastrous, stultifying effect, Traisterâ€™s latest is timely and crucial. It offers a glimpse into the galvanizing force of womenâ€™s collective anger, which, when harnessed, can change history.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":320,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.50"},"rating_count":2217,"review_count":409,"genres":"Nonfiction|Feminism|Politics|History|Womens","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1538302374l/39312319.jpg"}

Paul can't let an incident from his past go. When he finds out a rival detective agency played a key role in it, he drags MCM Investigations into a blood feud that they can't hope to win. Soon they're faced with the prospect of the company going out of business and Brigit going out of her damn mind. When long-buried bodies are discovered in the Wicklow Mountains, Bunny's past starts closing in on him too. Who can he trust when he can't even trust himself? When he finds himself with nowhere left to run and nobody he can turn to, will the big fella make the ultimate sacrifice to protect the ones he loves? When all that's left is the fall, the fall is everything. And even the mighty fall. Last Orders is the thrilling conclusion of the critically acclaimed Dublin Trilogy, which melds fast-paced action with a distinctly Irish acerbic wit.

Gbessa, exiled from the West African village of Lai, is starved, bitten by a viper, and left for dead, but still she survives. June Dey, raised on a plantation in Virginia, hides his unusual strength until a confrontation with the overseer forces him to flee. Norman Aragon, the child of a white British colonizer and a Maroon slave from Jamaica, can fade from sight when the earth calls him. When the three meet in the settlement of Monrovia, their gifts help them salvage the tense relationship between the African American settlers and the indigenous tribes, as a new nation forms around them.Mooreâ€™s intermingling of history and magical realism finds voice not just in these three characters but also in the fleeting spirit of the wind, who embodies an ancient wisdom. 'If she was not a woman,' the wind says of Gbessa, 'she would be king.'

Handsome, charismatic, a powerful athlete and oarsman, David Sparsholt seems at first unaware of the effect he has on others--especially on the lonely and romantic Evert Dax, son of a celebrated novelist, himself also destined to become a writer. While the Blitz rages in London, Oxford exists at a strange remove from the action: a place of transience and uncertainty, the fears and rigors of the blackout both encouraging and concealing unexpected liaisons. Between these two young men of very different backgrounds an unusual friendship develops, one whose consequences will unfold over the many years that follow.Alan Hollinghurst's masterly new novel evokes the intimate lives of three generations of Sparsholts in a sequence of vividly rendered episodes: a childhood holiday in Cornwall; eccentric social gatherings at the Dax family home; the adventures of David's son Johnny, in pursuit of love and a career as a painter in 1970s London. Changes in taste, morality, and private life are explored in a group portrait of friends brought together by art, literature, and love. Champions of the Modern live to see modernity itself becoming history, while more personal, life-changing crises and scandals--including that which gives this novel its title--recede into the past, leaving their ambiguous traces. And as gay men and women live in increasing freedom and openness, and the gay scene evolves into new forms and possibilities, The Sparsholt Affair becomes a meditation on human transience, even as it expresses the countervailing longing for permanence and continuity.Witty, tender, epic in scope yet rich in observation, The Sparsholt Affair is a dazzling new work of fiction by a writer justly hailed by the Wall Street Journal as 'one of the best novelists at work today.'","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":419,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.59"},"rating_count":2885,"review_count":499,"genres":"Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Lgbt|Glbt|Queer|Literary Fiction|Historical","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1512243417l/35794822.jpg"}

It is a red state in the heart of Trumpland that hasn't elected a Democrat to a statewide office in more than twenty years; but it is also a state in which minorities already form a majority (including the largest number of Muslims). The cities are blue and among the most diverse in the nation. Oil is still king but Texas now leads California in technology exports. The Texas economic model of low taxes and minimal regulation has produced extraordinary growth but also striking income disparities. Texas looks a lot like the America that Donald Trump wants to create. And Wright's profound portrait of the state not only reflects our country back as it is, but as it was and as it might be.","edition":"","format":"Audible Audio","pages":0,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.07"},"rating_count":2051,"review_count":336,"genres":"Nonfiction|History|Politics|Travel|Audiobook","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1525753630l/40059123.jpg"}

Gray","description":"From the provocative author of Straw Dogs comes an incisive, surprising intervention in the political and scientific debate over religion and atheismWhen you explore older atheisms, you will find that some of your firmest convictions--secular or religious--are highly questionable. If this prospect disturbs you, what you are looking for may be freedom from thought.For a generation now, public debate has been corroded by a shrill, narrow derision of religion in the name of an often vaguely understood 'science.' John Gray's stimulating and enjoyable new book, Seven Types of Atheism, describes the complex, dynamic world of older atheisms, a tradition that is, he writes, in many ways intertwined with and as rich as religion itself.Along a spectrum that ranges from the convictions of 'God-haters' like the Marquis de Sade to the mysticism of Arthur Schopenhauer, from Bertrand Russell's search for truth in mathematics to secular political religions like Jacobinism and Nazism, Gray explores the various ways great minds have attempted to understand the questions of salvation, purpose, progress, and evil. The result is a book that sheds an extraordinary light on what it is to be human.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":176,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.86"},"rating_count":244,"review_count":52,"genres":"Philosophy|Religion|Nonfiction|History|Religion|Atheism","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1531928876l/37941848.jpg"}

As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual fire alarm. As one fireman recounted, 'Once that first stack got going, it was â€˜Goodbye, Charlie.â€™' The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the libraryâ€”and if so, who?Weaving her lifelong love of books and reading into an investigation of the fire, award-winning New Yorker reporter and New York Times bestselling author Susan Orlean delivers a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling book that manages to tell the broader story of libraries and librarians in a way that has never been done before.In The Library Book, Orlean chronicles the LAPL fire and its aftermath to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives; delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from their humble beginnings as a metropolitan charitable initiative to their current status as a cornerstone of national identity; brings each department of the library to vivid life through on-the-ground reporting; studies arson and attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; reflects on her own experiences in libraries; and reexamines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the LAPL more than thirty years ago.Along the way, Orlean introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters from libraries past and presentâ€”from Mary Foy, who in 1880 at eighteen years old was named the head of the Los Angeles Public Library at a time when men still dominated the role, to Dr. C.J.K. Jones, a pastor, citrus farmer, and polymath known as 'The Human Encyclopedia' who roamed the library dispensing information; from Charles Lummis, a wildly eccentric journalist and adventurer who was determined to make the L.A. library one of the best in the world, to the current staff, who do heroic work every day to ensure that their institution remains a vital part of the city it serves.Brimming with her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, The Library Book is Susan Orleanâ€™s thrilling journey through the stacks that reveals how these beloved institutions provide much more than just booksâ€”and why they remain an essential part of the heart, mind, and soul of our country. It is also a master journalistâ€™s reminder that, perhaps especially in the digital era, they are more necessary than ever.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":318,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.20"},"rating_count":5129,"review_count":1406,"genres":"Nonfiction|History|Writing|Books About Books|Crime|True Crime","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1524238338l/39507318.jpg"}

Two years earlier: Moving back to Israel after several years in Pennsylvania, Jonathan is ready to fight to preserve and defend the Jewish state, which his grandfatherâ€”a Salonican Jew whose community was wiped out by the Nazisâ€”helped establish. But he is also conflicted about the possibility of having to monitor the occupied Palestinian territories, a concern that grows deeper and more urgent when he meets Nimreen and Laithâ€”the twin daughter and son of his motherâ€™s friend.From that winter morning on, the three become inseparable: wandering the streets on weekends, piling onto buses toward new discoveries, laughing uncontrollably. They share joints on the beach, trading snippets of poems, intimate secrets, family histories, resentments, and dreams. But with his draft date rapidly approaching, Jonathan wrestles with the question of what it means to be proud of your heritage and loyal to your people, while also feeling love for those outside of your own tribal family.

How had Donald Trump won the White House? How was it that a decent and thoughtful president had been succeeded by a buffoonish reality star, and what do we do now?Instead of throwing away his phone and moving to another country (which were his first and second thoughts), Pfeiffer decided to tell this surreal story, recounting how Barack Obama navigated the insane political forces that created Trump, explaining why everyone got 2016 wrong, and offering a path for where Democrats go from here.Pfeiffer was one of Obama's first hires when he decided to run for president, and was at his side through two presidential campaigns and six years in the White House.

She was the rarest of female psychopaths, a woman who engaged in wholesale slaughter, partly out of greed but mostly for the sheer joy of it. Between 1902 and 1908, she lured a succession of unsuspecting victims to her Indiana 'murder farm.' Some were hired hands. Others were well-to-do bachelors. All of them vanished without a trace. When their bodies were dug up, they hadnâ€™t merely been poisoned, like victims of other female killers. Theyâ€™d been butchered.Hellâ€™s Princess is a riveting account of one of the most sensational killing sprees in the annals of American crime: the shocking series of murders committed by the woman who came to be known as Lady Bluebeard. The only definitive book on this notorious case and the first to reveal previously unknown information about its subject, Harold Schechterâ€™s gripping, suspenseful narrative has all the elements of a classic mysteryâ€”and all the gruesome twists of a nightmare.","edition":"","format":"Paperback","pages":334,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.38"},"rating_count":6551,"review_count":740,"genres":"Crime|True Crime|Nonfiction|History|Biography|Mystery|Crime","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1508570320l/34663059.jpg"}

This instinct to take every measure, even the most aggressive, to defend the Jewish people is hardwired into Israelâ€™s DNA. From the very beginning of its statehood in 1948, protecting the nation from harm has been the responsibility of its intelligence community and armed services, and there is one weapon in their vast arsenal that they have relied upon to thwart the most serious threats: Targeted assassinations have been used countless times, on enemies large and small, sometimes in response to attacks against the Israeli people and sometimes preemptively. In this page-turning, eye-opening book, journalist and military analyst Ronen Bergman offers a riveting inside account of the targeted killing programsâ€”their successes, their failures, and the moral and political price exacted on the men and women who approved and carried out the missions.Bergman has gained the exceedingly rare cooperation of many current and former members of the Israeli government, including Prime Ministers Shimon Peres, Ehud Barak, Ariel Sharon, and Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as high-level figures in the countryâ€™s military and intelligence services: the IDF (Israel Defense Forces), the Mossad (the worldâ€™s most feared intelligence agency), Caesarea (a 'Mossad within the Mossad' that carries out attacks on the highest-value targets), and the Shin Bet (an internal security service that implemented the largest targeted assassination campaign ever, in order to stop what had once appeared to be unstoppable: suicide terrorism).Including never-before-reported, behind-the-curtain accounts of key operations, and based on hundreds of on-the-record interviews and thousands of files to which Bergman has gotten exclusive access over his decades of reporting, Rise and Kill First brings us deep into the heart of Israelâ€™s most secret activities. Bergman traces, from statehood to the present, the gripping events and thorny ethical questions underlying Israelâ€™s targeted killing campaign, which has shaped the Israeli nation, the Middle East, and the entire world.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":784,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.41"},"rating_count":1490,"review_count":163,"genres":"History|Nonfiction|Cultural|Israel|Politics|War|Spy Thriller|Espionage","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1495743181l/33598223.jpg"}

Under the headline: 'Experts in authoritarianism advise to keep a list of things subtly changing around you, so you'll remember,' Siskind's 'Weekly List' began as a project she shared with friends, but it soon went viral and now has more than half a million viewers every week.Compiled in one volume for the first time, The List is a first draft history and a comprehensive accounting of Donald Trump's first year. Beginning with Trump's acceptance of white supremacists the week after the election and concluding a year to the day later, we watch as Trump and his regime chips away at the rights and protections of marginalized communities, of women, of us all, via Twitter storms, unchecked executive action, and shifting rules and standards. The List chronicles not only the scandals that made headlines but just as important, the myriad smaller but still consequential unprecedented acts that otherwise fall through cracks.

Robbie Parsons is one of Londonâ€™s finest, a black cab driver who knows every street, every theater, every landmark in the city by heart. In his backseat is a man with a gun in his handâ€”a man who brazenly committed a crime in front of the Artemis Club, a rarefied art gallery-cum-casino, then jumped in and ordered Parsons to drive.

Two days previously, Jury had met and instantly connected with one of the victims of the crime, a professor of astrophysics at Columbia and an expert gambler. Feeling personally affronted, Jury soon enlists Melrose Plant, Marshall Trueblood, and his whole gang of merry characters to contend with a case that takes unexpected turns into Tanzanian gem mines, a closed casino in Reno, Nevada, and a pub that only Londonâ€™s black cabbies, those who have 'the knowledge,' can find.

The ship is instantly transformed into a fiery cauldron and sinks within minutes. Some 300 men go down with the ship. Nearly 900 make it into the water alive. For the next five nights and four days, almost three hundred miles from the nearest land, the men battle injuries, sharks, dehydration, insanity, and eventually each other. Only 316 will survive. For the better part of a century, the story of USS Indianapolis has been understood as a sinking tale. The reality, however, is far more complicatedâ€”and compelling. Now, for the first time, thanks to a decade of original research and interviews with 107 survivors and eyewitÂ­nesses, Lynn Vincent and Sara Vladic tell the complete story of the ship, her crew, and their final mission to save one of their own. It begins in 1932, when Indianapolis is christened and launched as the ship of state for President Franklin Roosevelt. After Pearl Harbor, Indianapolis leads the charge to the Pacific Islands, notching an unbroken string of victories in an uncharted theater of war. Then, under orders from President Harry Truman, the ship takes aboard a superspy and embarks on her final world-changing mission: delivering the core of the atomic bomb to the Pacific for the strike on Hiroshima. Vincent and Vladic provide a visceral, moment-by-moment account of the disaster that unfolds days later after the Japanese torpedo attack, from the chaos on board the sinking ship to the first moments of shock as the crew plunge into the remote waters of the Philippine Sea, to the long days and nights during which terror and hunger morph into delusion and desperation, and the men must band together to survive. Then, for the first time, the authors go beyond the menâ€™s rescue to chronicle Indianapolisâ€™s extraordinary final mission: the survivorsâ€™ fifty-year fight for justice on behalf of their skipper, Captain Charles McVay III, who is wrongly court-martialed for the sinking. What follows is a captivating courtroom drama that weaves through generations of American presidents, from Harry Truman to George W. Bush, and forever entwines the lives of three captainsâ€”McVay, whose life and career are never the same after the scandal; Mochitsura Hashimoto, the Japanese sub commander who sinks Indianapolis but later joins the battle to exonerate McVay; and William Toti, the captain of the modern-day submarine Indianapolis, who helps the survivors fight to vindicate their captain. A sweeping saga of survival, sacrifice, justice, and love, Indianapolis stands as both groundbreaking naval history and spellbinding narrativeâ€”and brings the ship and her heroic crew back to full, vivid, unforgettable life. It is the definitive account of one of the most remarkable episodes in American history.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":592,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.50"},"rating_count":1283,"review_count":301,"genres":"History|Nonfiction|War|War|World War II|North American Hi...|American History|War|Military Fiction","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1531039194l/36373560.jpg"}

Too sensitive, or not sensitive enough. Too dowdy or too made-up. Too big or too thin. Sluts or prudes. We are harassed, told we are asking for it, and asked if it would kill us to smile. Yes, yes it would.Contrary to the rhetoric of popular 'self-help' and an entire lifetime of being told otherwise, our rage is one of the most important resources we have, our sharpest tool against both personal and political oppression. Weâ€™ve been told for so long to bottle up our anger, letting it corrode our bodies and minds in ways we donâ€™t even realize. Yet our anger is a vital instrument, our radar for injustice and a catalyst for change. On the flip side, the societal and cultural belittlement of our anger is a cunning way of limiting and controlling our power.We are so often told to resist our rage or punished for justifiably expressing it, yet how many remarkable achievements in this world would never have gotten off the ground without the kernel of anger that fueled them? Rage Becomes Her makes the case that anger is not what gets in our way, it is our way, sparking a new understanding of one of our core emotions that will give women a liberating sense of why their anger matters and connect them to an entire universe of women no longer interested in making nice at all costs.Following in the footsteps of classic feminist manifestos like The Feminine Mystique and Our Bodies, Ourselves, Rage Becomes Her is an eye-opening book for the twenty-first century woman: an engaging, accessible credo offering us the tools to re-understand our anger and harness its power to create lasting positive change.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":364,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.36"},"rating_count":637,"review_count":143,"genres":"Nonfiction|Feminism|Writing|Essays|Politics|Womens","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1536485995l/38532207.jpg"}

Our lives are a never-ending stream of 'when' decisions: when to start a business, schedule a class, get serious about a person.

That day, of course, the world changed. By the next morning, with seventeen classmates and faculty dead, they had joined the leadership of a movement to save their own lives, and the lives of all other young people in America. It's a leadership position they did not seek, and did not want--but events gave them no choice.The morning after the massacre, David Hogg told CNN: 'We're children. You guys are the adults. You need to take some action and play a role. Work together. Get over your politics and get something done.'This book is a manifesto for the movement begun that day, one that has already changed America--with voices of a new generation that are speaking truth to power, and are determined to succeed where their elders have failed. With moral force and clarity, a new generation has made it clear that problems previously deemed unsolvable due to powerful lobbies and political cowardice will be theirs to solve. Born just after Columbine and raised amid seemingly endless war and routine active shooter drills, this generation now says,Â Enough. This book is their statement of purpose, and the story of their lives. It is the essential guide to the #NeverAgain movement.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":166,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.20"},"rating_count":753,"review_count":165,"genres":"Nonfiction|Politics|Social Issues|Activism|Autobiography|Memoir|Social Movements|Social Justice","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1524109194l/39891586.jpg"}

Forty minutes later, rescuers found the body of four-year-old Eldon. Miraculously, his seven-year-old sister, Trinity, was saved. As the public cried out for blood, Amanda was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to thirty-five years in prison.Embarking on a seven-year quest for the truth, Rommelmann traced the roots of Amandaâ€™s fury and desperation through thousands of pages of records, withheld documents, meetings with lawyers and convicts, and interviews with friends and family who felt shocked, confused, and emotionally swindled by a woman whose entire life was now defined by an unspeakable crime. At the heart of that crime: a tempestuous marriage, a family on the fast track to self-destruction, and a myriad of secrets and lies as dark and turbulent as the Willamette River.  'In To the Bridge, Nancy Rommelmann takes what many consider the most unforgivable of crimesâ€”a mother set on murdering her own childrenâ€”and delivers something thoughtful and provocative: a deeply reported, sensitively told, all-too-relevant tragedy of addiction and codependency, toxic masculinity, and capricious justice. You wonâ€™t be able to look awayâ€”nor should any of us.' â€”Robert Kolker, New York Times bestselling author of Lost Girls: An Unsolved American Mystery 'How do you understand the not understandable and forgive the unforgivable? So asks one of the characters in this clear-eyed investigation into something we all turn away from. To the Bridge is a tour de force of both journalism and compassion, in the lineage of such masterpieces as In Cold Blood and The Executionerâ€™s Song.

{"_id":{"$oid":"6095f2e31eb6a85a10c5ac91"},"book_id":"c17063b9","title":"Harbor of Spies: A Novel of Historic Havana","authors":"Robin  Lloyd","description":"HARBOR OF SPIES is an historical novel set in Havana in 1863 during the American Civil War, when the Spanish colonial city was alive with intrigue and war related espionage. The protagonist - a young American ship captain by the name of Everett Townsend - is pulled into the war, not as a Naval Academy midshipman, as he had once hoped, but as the captain of a Havana-based blockade-running schooner. Even as Townsend gets entangled in the war effort, he also finds himself being pulled into the dangerous investigation of a murdered English diplomat which threatens his own life. Townsend becomes ensnared in the investigation of the Backhouse murder by rescuing a man from the sea, who turns out to be a prison escapee from El Morro Castle. That good deed to help this stranger condemns the protagonist himself to a Spanish prison, and sets in motion a plot where Townsend struggles to maintain his own sense of identity. He falls into the clutches of a Spanish merchant, who is making money off the American war, who introduces him to a world of spies, slave traders, and Spanish seductresses. From the bars, to the docks, to the dance halls, Townsend takes us into colonial Havana and then to the slave plantations in the interior even as he prepares his ship to run the blockade. The protagonist's trouble-ridden experience leads him to become emotionally involved with the daughter of an American innkeeper in Havana. Together they help each other grapple with the uncertain moral terrain of a city caught up in the American war and the growing controversy over slavery. Throughout the novel, Townsend can never shake loose the mystery about the man he helped save. As a foreigner and an outsider, he finds himself trapped by mysterious forces and circumstances beyond his control which ironically help him discover his own family roots in Cuba, and finally convince him to become a spy for the North. The novel is not only a richly drawn portrait of Spanish colonial Havana in the days when Cuba was flush with sugar wealth, but also provides a realistic look at the blockade runners that helped form the supply line into the South's Gulf ports. A little-known fact about blockade running in the Gulf of Mexico in the early years of the Civil War is the important role that sailing schooners played in bringing arms and ammunition into the shallow harbors, bays and inlets that line the Gulf coast from Florida to Texas.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":308,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.05"},"rating_count":73,"review_count":28,"genres":"Historical|Historical Fiction|Fiction|War|Military History|Civil War|Abandoned","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1512678875l/35743608.jpg"}

Eden|Justine Eyre","description":"When Evangeline is sent to live in a small mill town in Northern England as a schoolteacher in 1871, she finds herself struggling to fit in with an unfamiliar culture. Raised with the high-class Victorian values and ideals of a sophisticated upbringing, she is unprepared for the poverty she finds in the gritty factory town of Smeatley, where the locals speak with a hard-to-understand Yorkshire accent and struggle to thrive with few resources or opportunities. Though she has no training as a teacher, she must prove herself successful before her grandfather will release her substantial inheritance to her and allow her to be reunited with her younger sister, the last remaining member of her family after a fever claimed the lives of her parents and brothers. Evangeline's sudden change in circumstances is complicated when her auntâ€”a woman who values class distinctions more than her family relationshipsâ€”forbids her from acknowledging any connection to her or to her grandfather, Mr. Farrâ€”the man who owns nearly the entire town. For the first time in her life, Evangeline is truly alone. Heartbroken, she turns to the one person in town who has shown her kindnessâ€”an Irish brick mason, Dermot, and his son, Ronan. Despite the difference in their classes and backgrounds, Evangeline and Dermot become friends, due in part to her ability to connect with Ronan, whose behavior requires special attention. The boy is uncomfortable around strangers and rarely even speaks to the other children in town. He often fixates on details other people ignore, and he adheres to specific, self-made rules that give his life order and structure; for example, Dermot's coat must be hung on a specific peg next to the door. Evangeline attempts to prove herself a worthy teacher and earn the respect of her hard-to-understand students. Determined to find a way to introduce them to 'proper English' while still honoring their unique language and culture, she enlists the help of a local family to write down familiar stories in the Yorkshire vernacular. Because of her efforts, the students and their families warm to Evangeline and she continues to look for ways to give the children a chance to become more than factory workers in the local cotton mill. When the town learns of her upper-class status, Evangeline must work twice as hard to win back their trust--especially Dermot's.

What's more, every year conventional burials in the U.S. bury 800,000 gallons of embalming fluid, containing carcinogenic formaldehyde; hundreds of thousands of tons of wood, steel, copper, and bronze caskets; and millions of tons of concrete vaults. There is a better way and Fournier, affectionately dubbed the 'Green Reaper,' walks readers through it, step-by-step. With green burial and home funeral basics to legal how and what's; choices in practices (at home, at sea, etc.); and even detours into examples of celebrity green burials; this is comprehensive and compassionate guidance. The idea of a 'good death' has been much discussed. Fournier points the way to good post-deaths, ones that consider the environmental well-being of the planet and the economic well-being of loved ones.","edition":"First","format":"Paperback","pages":178,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.37"},"rating_count":27,"review_count":9,"genres":"Nonfiction","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1506060703l/36282255.jpg"}

In Jefferson's Daughters, Catherine Kerrison, a scholar of early American and women's history, recounts the remarkable journey of these three women - and how their struggle to define themselves reflects both the possibilities and the limitations that resulted from the American Revolution. Although the three women shared a father, the similarities end there. Martha and Maria received a fine convent school education while they lived with their father during his diplomatic posting in Paris - a hothouse of intellectual ferment whose celebrated salonniÃ¨res are vividly brought to life in Kerrison's narrative. Once they returned home, however, the sisters found their options limited by the laws and customs of early America. Harriet Hemings followed a different path. She escaped slavery - apparently with the assistance of Jefferson himself. Leaving Monticello behind, she boarded a coach and set off for a decidedly uncertain future. For this groundbreaking triple biography, Kerrison has uncovered never-before-published documents written by the Jefferson sisters when they were in their teens, as well as letters written by members of the Jefferson and Hemings families. She has interviewed Hemings family descendants (and, with their cooperation, initiating DNA testing) and searched for possible descendants of Harriet Hemings.The eventful lives of Thomas Jefferson's daughters provide a unique vantage point from which to examine the complicated patrimony of the American Revolution itself. The richly interwoven story of these three strong women and their fight to shape their own destinies sheds new light on the ongoing movement toward human rights in America - and on the personal and political legacy of one of our most controversial Founding Fathers.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":425,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.65"},"rating_count":803,"review_count":200,"genres":"History|Nonfiction|Biography|Historical|North American Hi...|American History","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492222278l/34859714.jpg"}

A Russian migrant in Tokyo agonizes over the money her lover accepts from a yakuza. A dead body on a drug dealerâ€™s floor leads to the strangest first date ever.

In 'Maria of the Grapes,' a pair of damaged runaways get lost in the seductive underworld beneath Tokyoâ€™s clean streets; in 'Pretoria,' a South African expat longs for the chaos of her homeland as she contemplates a marriage proposal; in 'Girl Canadian Shipwreck,' a young woman in Brooklyn seeks permission to flee from her boyfriend and his terrible performance art; in 'Maureen,' an aspiring writer realizes that her beautiful, neurotic boss is lonelier than she lets on.The Island Dwellers ranges near and far in its exploration of solitude and reinvention, identity and sexuality, family and home.

Whole Hearts.","authors":"BrenÃ© Brown","description":"8 Hours and 30 MinutesIn her #1 New York Times bestsellers, Brenï¿½ Brown taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong, and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers, and culture shifters, she's showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead.Leadership is not about titles, status, and power over people. Leaders are people who hold themselves accountable for recognizing the potential in people and ideas and developing that potential. This is a book for everyone who is ready to choose courage over comfort, make a difference, and lead.When we dare to lead, we don't pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don't see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it and work to align authority and accountability. We don't avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into the vulnerability that's necessary to do good work.But daring leadership in a culture that's defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty requires building courage skills, which are uniquely human. The irony is that we're choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the same time we're scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines can't do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection, and courage to start.Brenï¿½ Brown spent the past two decades researching the emotions that give meaning to our lives. Over the past seven years, she found that leaders in organizations ranging from small entrepreneurial startups and family-owned businesses to nonprofits, civic organizations, and Fortune 50 companies, are asking the same questions:How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders? And, how do you embed the value of courage in your culture?Dare to Lead answers these questions and gives us actionable strategies and real examples from her new research-based, courage-building program.Brenï¿½ writes, 'One of the most important findings of my career is that courage can be taught, developed, and measured. Courage is a collection of four skill sets supported by twenty-eight behaviors. All it requires is a commitment to doing bold work, having tough conversations, and showing up with our whole hearts. Easy? No. Choosing courage over comfort is not easy. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and work.

In Homo Deus, he looked to our future. Now, one of the most innovative thinkers on the planet turns to the present to make sense of today's most pressing issues.How do computers and robots change the meaning of being human? How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children?Yuval Noah Harari's 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary investigation into today's most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?Harari's unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers. Here he invites us to consider values, meaning, and personal engagement in a world full of noise and uncertainty. When we are deluged with irrelevant information, clarity is power. Presenting complex contemporary challenges clearly and accessibly, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is essential reading.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":372,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.22"},"rating_count":12562,"review_count":1376,"genres":"Nonfiction|History|Philosophy|Science|Politics","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1529556215l/38820046.jpg"}

Christian Miller|Ken Armstrong","description":"Two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists tell the riveting true story of Marie, a teenager who was charged with lying about having been raped, and the detectives who followed a winding path to arrive at the truth. On August 11, 2008, eighteen-year-old Marie reported that a masked man broke into her apartment near Seattle, Washington, and raped her, but within days police and even those closest to Marie became suspicious of her story. The police swiftly pivoted and began investigating her. Confronted with inconsistencies in her story and the doubts of others, Marie broke down and said her story was a lie. Police charged her with false reporting. One of her best friends created a web page branding her a liar.More than two years later, Colorado detective Stacy Galbraith was assigned to investigate a case of sexual assault. Describing the crime to her husband that night--the attacker's calm and practiced demeanor, which led the victim to surmise 'he's done this before'--Galbraith learned that the case bore an eerie resemblance to a rape that had taken place months earlier in a nearby town. She joined forces with the detective on that case, Edna Hendershot, and the two soon realized they were dealing with a serial rapist: a man who photographed his victims, threatening to release the images online, and whose calculated steps to erase all physical evidence suggested he might be a soldier or a cop. Through meticulous police work the detectives would eventually connect the rapist to other attacks in Colorado--and beyond.Based on investigative files and extensive interviews with the principals, An Unbelievable Story is a serpentine tale of doubt, lies, and a hunt for justice, unveiling the disturbing reality of how sexual assault is investigated today--and the long history of skepticism toward rape victims.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":304,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.28"},"rating_count":2275,"review_count":452,"genres":"Nonfiction|Crime|True Crime|Feminism|Mystery|Crime","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1502692660l/35805861.jpg"}

Though this was only one regular season game, the match-up of these two teams demonstrated how Major League Baseball has changed since the early days of Athletics general manager Billy Beane and the publication of Michael Lewisâ€™ classic book.Over the past twenty years, power and analytics have taken over the game, driving carefully calibrated teams like the Astros to victory. Seemingly every pitcher now throws mid-90s heat and studiously compares their mechanics against the ideal. Every batter in the lineup can crack homers and knows their launch angles. Teams are relying on unorthodox strategies, including using power-losingâ€”purposely tanking a few seasons to get the best players in the draft.As he chronicles each inning and the unfolding drama as these two teams continually trade the leadâ€”culminating in a 9-8 Oakland victory in the bottom of the ninthâ€”Neyer considers the players and managers, the front office machinations, the role of sabermetrics, and the current thinking about what it takes to build a great team, to answer the most pressing questions fans have about the sport today.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":320,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.16"},"rating_count":121,"review_count":27,"genres":"Sports|Baseball|Sports and Games|Sports|Nonfiction|History","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1538972698l/38205583.jpg"}

Despair and uncertainty surround us: in the news, in our families, and in ourselves. But even when life is at its bleakest--when we are, as she puts it, 'doomed, stunned, exhausted, and over-caffeinated'--the seeds of rejuvenation are at hand. 'All truth is paradox,' Lamott writes, 'and this turns out to be a reason for hope. If you arrive at a place in life that is miserable, it will change.' That is the time when we must pledge not to give up but 'to do what Wendell Berry wrote: 'Be joyful, though you have considered all the facts.''In this profound and funny book, Lamott calls for each of us to rediscover the nuggets of hope and wisdom that are buried within us that can make life sweeter than we ever imagined. Divided into short chapters that explore life's essential truths, Almost Everything pinpoints these moments of insight as it shines an encouraging light forward.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":208,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.73"},"rating_count":2333,"review_count":331,"genres":"Nonfiction|Writing|Essays|Autobiography|Memoir|Spirituality|Self Help","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1539780476l/39203790.jpg"}

Which is why itâ€™s so unnerving that sheâ€™s arrived at middle age with nothing to show for her hard work and dedication but a stack of unpaid bills and an inherited brick home in Vineland, New Jersey, that is literally falling apart. The magazine where she worked has folded, and the college where her husband had tenure has closed. The dilapidated house is also home to her ailing and cantankerous Greek father-in-law and her two grown children: her stubborn, free-spirited daughter, Tig, and her dutiful debt-ridden, ivy educated son, Zeke, who has arrived with his unplanned baby in the wake of a life-shattering development.In an act of desperation, Willa begins to investigate the history of her home, hoping that the local historical preservation society might take an interest and provide funding for its direly needed repairs. Through her research into Vinelandâ€™s past and its creation as a Utopian community, she discovers a kindred spirit from the 1880s, Thatcher Greenwood.A science teacher with a lifelong passion for honest investigation, Thatcher finds himself under siege in his community for telling the truth: his employer forbids him to speak of the exciting new theory recently published by Charles Darwin. Thatcherâ€™s friendships with a brilliant woman scientist and a renegade newspaper editor draw him into a vendetta with the townâ€™s most powerful men. At home, his new wife and status-conscious mother-in-law bristle at the risk of scandal, and dismiss his financial worries and the news that their elegant house is structurally unsound.Brilliantly executed and compulsively readable, Unsheltered is the story of two families, in two centuries, who live at the corner of Sixth and Plum, as they navigate the challenges of surviving a world in the throes of major cultural shifts. In this mesmerizing story told in alternating chapters, Willa and Thatcher come to realize that though the future is uncertain, even unnerving, shelter can be found in the bonds of kindredâ€”whether family or friendsâ€”and in the strength of the human spirit.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":464,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.69"},"rating_count":7781,"review_count":1467,"genres":"Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Literary Fiction|Contemporary|Audiobook|Abandoned|Historical|Adult Fiction|Did Not Finish|Novels","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1527384246l/38236861.jpg"}

Setting a precedent as First Lady, Betty Ford refused to be silenced by her critics as she publicly championed equal rights for women, and spoke out about issues that had previously been tabooâ€”breast cancer, depression, abortion, and sexuality. Privately, there were signs something was wrong. After a painful intervention by her family, she admitted to an addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs. Her courageous decision to speak out publicly sparked a national dialogue, and in 1982, she co-founded the Betty Ford Center, which revolutionized treatment for alcoholism and inspired the modern concept of recovery. Lisa McCubbin also brings to light Gerald and Betty Fordâ€™s sweeping love story: from Michigan to the White House, until their dying days, their relationship was that of a man and woman utterly devoted to one another otherâ€”a relationship built on trust, respect, and an unquantifiable chemistry. Based on intimate in-depth interviews with all four of her children, Susan Ford Bales, Michael Ford, Jack Ford, and Steven Ford, as well as family friends, and colleagues, Betty Ford: First Lady, Womenâ€™s Advocate, Survivor, Trailblazer is a deeply personal, empathic portrait of an outspoken First Lady, who was first and foremost a devoted wife and mother. With poignant details and rare insight, McCubbin reveals a fiercely independent woman who had a lively sense of humor, unwavering faith, and an indomitable spiritâ€”the true story behind one of the most admired and influential women of our time.","edition":"","format":"Audiobook","pages":0,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.40"},"rating_count":209,"review_count":66,"genres":"Biography|Nonfiction|History|North American Hi...|American History|Womens","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1535195783l/39312754.jpg"}

He went out on to his balcony above the flat landscape of southern Holland to watch the air armada of Dakotas and gliders carrying the British 1st Airborne and the American 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions. He gazed up in envy at this massive demonstration of paratroop power.Operation Market Garden, the plan to end the war by capturing the bridges leading to the Lower Rhine and beyond, was a bold concept: the Americans thought it unusually bold for Field Marshal Montgomery. But could it ever have worked? The cost of failure was horrendous, above all for the Dutch, who risked everything to help. German reprisals were pitiless and cruel, and lasted until the end of the war.The British fascination with heroic failure has clouded the story of Arnhem in myths. Antony Beevor, using often overlooked sources from Dutch, British, American, Polish and German archives, has reconstructed the terrible reality of the fighting, which General Student himself called 'The Last German Victory'. Yet this book, written in Beevor's inimitable and gripping narrative style, is about much more than a single, dramatic battle. It looks into the very heart of war.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":459,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.29"},"rating_count":511,"review_count":96,"genres":"History|Nonfiction|Military|Military History|War|War|Military Fiction|War|World War II","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1512971514l/32934807.jpg"}

Max Hastings has spent the past three years interviewing scores of participants on both sides, as well as researching a multitude of American and Vietnamese documents and memoirs, to create an epic narrative of an epic struggle. He portrays the set pieces of Dienbienphu, the 1968 Tet offensive, the air blitz of North Vietnam, and also much less familiar miniatures such as the bloodbath at Daido, where a US Marine battalion was almost wiped out, together with extraordinary recollections of Ho Chi Minhâ€™s warriors. Here are the vivid realities of strife amid jungle and paddies that killed two million people.Many writers treat the war as a US tragedy, yet Hastings sees it as overwhelmingly that of the Vietnamese people, of whom forty died for every American. US blunders and atrocities were matched by those committed by their enemies. While all the world has seen the image of a screaming, naked girl seared by napalm, it forgets countless eviscerations, beheadings, and murders carried out by the communists. The people of both former Vietnams paid a bitter price for the Northernersâ€™ victory in privation and oppression. Here is testimony from Vietcong guerrillas, Southern paratroopers, Saigon bargirls, and Hanoi students alongside that of infantrymen from South Dakota, Marines from North Carolina, and Huey pilots from Arkansas.No past volume has blended a political and military narrative of the entire conflict with heart-stopping personal experiences, in the fashion that Max Hastingsâ€™ readers know so well. The author suggests that neither side deserved to win this struggle with so many lessons for the twenty-first century about the misuse of military might to confront intractable political and cultural challenges. He marshals testimony from warlords and peasants, statesmen and soldiers, to create an extraordinary record.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":896,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.42"},"rating_count":194,"review_count":34,"genres":"History|Nonfiction|Military|Military History|War|War|Military Fiction","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1508784853l/36099654.jpg"}

The pink covers, the flimsy paper, the zillion volumes in the series that kept you reading for your entire adolescence. Spurred by the commercial success of Sweet Valley High and The Babysitters Club, these were not the serious-issue YA novels of the 1970s, nor were they the blockbuster books of the Harry Potter and Twilight ilk. They were cheap, short, and utterly beloved.PAPERBACK CRUSH dives in deep to this golden age with affection, history, and a little bit of snark. Readers will discover (and fondly remember) girl-centric series on everything from correspondence (Pen Pals and Dear Diary) to sports (The Pink Parrots, Cheerleaders, and The Gymnasts) to a newspaper at an all-girls Orthodox Jewish middle school (The B.Y. Times) to a literal teen angel (Teen Angels: Heaven Can Wait, where an enterprising guardian angel named Cisco has to earn her wings 'by helping the worldâ€™s sexist rock star.') Some were blatant ripoffs of the successful series (looking at you, Sleepover Friends and The Girls of Canby Hall), some were sick-lit tearjerkers Ã  la Love Story (Abby, My Love) and some were just plain perplexing (Uncle Vampire??) But all of them represent that time gone by of girl-power and endless sessions of sustained silent reading.In six hilarious chapters (Friendship, Love, School, Family, Jobs, Terror, and Tragedy), Bustle Features Editor Gabrielle Moss takes the reader on a nostalgic tour of teen book covers of yore, digging deep into the history of the genre as well as the stories behind the best-known series.","edition":"","format":"Paperback","pages":256,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.89"},"rating_count":576,"review_count":198,"genres":"Nonfiction|Writing|Books About Books|History|Culture|Pop Culture","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1528396262l/40093255.jpg"}

But the time is now coming when the details of his estate will finally be revealed, and Stanleyâ€™s family is nervous.For his son Fred, the inheritance Stanley has long alluded to would soothe the pain caused by years of professional disappointment. By now, the Harvard Business School graduate had expected to be a financial tech god â€“ not a minor investor at a middling corporate firm, where he isnâ€™t even allowed to fly business class.Stanleyâ€™s daughter, Kate, is a middle manager with one of Silicon Valleyâ€™s most prestigious tech companies. She manages the capricious demands of her world-famous boss and the needs of her two young children all while supporting her would-be entrepreneur husband (just until his startup gets off the ground, which will surely be soon). But lately, Kate has been sensing something amiss; just because you say you have it all, it doesnâ€™t mean that you actually do. Stanleyâ€™s second wife, Mary Zhu, twenty-eight years his junior, has devoted herself to making her husband comfortable in every wayâ€”rubbing his feet, cooking his favorite dishes, massaging his ego. But lately, her commitment has waned; caring for a dying old man is far more difficult than she expected.Linda Liang, Stanleyâ€™s first wife, knows her ex better than anyone.

Single for nearly a decade, she might finally be ready for some romantic companionship.

Born in obscurity in Putney, he became a fixer for Cardinal Wolsey in the 1520s. After Wolsey's fall, Henry VIII promoted him to a series of ever greater offices, such that in the 1530s he was effectively running the country for the King. That decade was one of the most momentous in English history: it saw a religious break with the Pope, unprecedented use of parliament, the dissolution of all monasteries, and the coming of the Protestantism. Cromwell was central to all this, but establishing his role with precision has been notoriously difficult.Diarmaid MacCulloch's biography is the most complete life ever written of this elusive figure, making connections not previously seen and revealing the channels through which power in early Tudor England flowed. It overturns many received interpretations, for example that Cromwell and Anne Boleyn were allies because of their common religious sympathies, showing how he in fact destroyed her. It introduces the many different personalities contributing to these foundational years, all worrying about what MacCulloch calls the 'terrifyingly unpredictable' Henry VIII, and allows readers to feel that they are immersed in all this, that it is going on around them. For a time, the self-made 'ruffian', as he described himself - ruthless, adept in the exercise of power, quietly determined in religious revolution - was master of events. MacCulloch's biography for the first time reveals his true place in the making of modern England and Ireland, for good and ill.","edition":"1st U.K. edition","format":"Hardcover","pages":752,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"4.11"},"rating_count":47,"review_count":15,"genres":"Biography|History|Nonfiction","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1520095161l/38107934.jpg"}

Bill must first pay a visit to a reclusive client--but after Lori drops him off, a powerful storm drives her off course and leaves her stranded in an ancient, rambling inn called The King's Ransom. When Lori is spooked by ghostly noises in the night, Aunt Dimity reminds her rather tartly that not all ghosts intend to harm the living. But the longer Lori is stuck at the inn, the stranger things seem. She learns that the inn was once a hangout for smugglers, and that it's riddled with secret tunnels the smugglers used to reach a network of hidden caves. Then there's the inn's cook--a brawny, gruff ex-con--who seems to have a beef with a mysterious French guest. Are the noises Lori hears made by the spirits of long dead smugglers? Or should she be more worried by the inn's living inhabitants? Joining forces with her new friend Bishop Wyndham, and guided by Aunt Dimity's wise counsel, Lori sets out to discover once and for all who--or what--is haunting The King's Ransom.","edition":"","format":"Kindle Edition","pages":240,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.91"},"rating_count":805,"review_count":135,"genres":"Mystery|Fiction|Mystery|Cozy Mystery","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1509077868l/36484421.jpg"}

A major work of American history by an author with a flair for mesmerizing story-telling.' â€”ForbesHe lived in the present tenseâ€”in the cameraâ€™s lens. There was no frame he couldnâ€™t or wouldnâ€™t fill. He swung the heaviest bat, earned the most money, and incurred the biggest fines. Like all the new-fangled gadgets then flooding the marketplaceâ€”radios, automatic clothes washers, Brownie cameras, microphones and loudspeakersâ€”Babe Ruth 'made impossible events happen.' Aided by his crucial partnership with Christy Walshâ€”business manager, spin doctor, damage control wizard, and surrogate father, all stuffed into one tightly buttoned double-breasted suitâ€”Ruth drafted the blueprint for modern athletic stardom.His was a life of journeys and itinerariesâ€”from uncouth to couth,Â spartan to spendthrift, abandoned to abandon; from Baltimore to Boston to New York, and back to Boston at the end of his career for a finale with the only team that would have him. There were road trips and hunting trips; grand tours of foreign capitals and post-season promotional tours, not to mention those 714 trips around the bases.After hitting his 60th home run in September 1927â€”a total that would not be exceeded until 1961, when Roger Maris did it with the aid of the extended modern seasonâ€”he embarked on the mother of all barnstorming tours, a three-week victory lap across America, accompanied by Yankee teammate Lou Gehrig. Walsh called the tour a 'Symphony of Swat.' The Omaha World Herald called it 'the biggest show since Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey, and seven other associated circuses offered their entire performance under one tent.' In The Big Fella, acclaimed biographer Jane Leavy recreates that 21-day circus and in so doing captures the romp and the pathos that defined Ruthâ€™s life and times.Drawing from more than 250 interviews, a trove of previously untapped documents, and Ruth family records, Leavy breaks through the mythology that has obscured the legend and delivers the man.","edition":"","format":"ebook","pages":656,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.84"},"rating_count":137,"review_count":25,"genres":"Biography|Sports|Baseball|Sports and Games|Sports|Nonfiction|History","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1531865818l/36300609.jpg"}

The Greeks told of a tempestuous Hera and a cunning Zeus, but we now use genes and natural selection to explain fear and desire, and physics to demystify the workings of the universe.Science is an astounding achievement, but are we really any wiser than the ancients? Has science revealed the secrets of fate and immortality? Has it provided protection from jealousy or love? There are those who believe that science has replaced faith, but must it also be a death knell for mythology?Evolutions brings to life the latest scientific thinking on the birth of the universe and the solar system, the journey from a single cell all the way to our human minds. Reawakening our sense of wonder and terror at the world around us and within us, Oren Harman uses modern science to create new and original mythologies. Here are the earth and the moon presenting a cosmological view of motherhood, a panicking mitochondrion introducing sex and death to the world, the loneliness of consciousness emerging from the memory of an octopus, and the birth of language in evolution summoning humankind's struggle with truth. Science may not solve our existential puzzles, but like the age-old legends, its magical discoveries can help us continue the never-ending search.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":243,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.47"},"rating_count":59,"review_count":13,"genres":"Science|Nonfiction|Short Stories","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1527743489l/36722975.jpg"}

In the Greek camp, another womanâ€”Briseisâ€”watches and waits for the war's outcome. She was queen of one of Troy's neighboring kingdoms, until Achilles, Greece's greatest warrior, sacked her city and murdered her husband and brothers. Briseis becomes Achilles's concubine, a prize of battle, and must adjust quickly in order to survive a radically different life, as one of the many conquered women who serve the Greek army. When Agamemnon, the brutal political leader of the Greek forces, demands Briseis for himself, she finds herself caught between the two most powerful of the Greeks. Achilles refuses to fight in protest, and the Greeks begin to lose ground to their Trojan opponents. Keenly observant and coolly unflinching about the daily horrors of war, Briseis finds herself in an unprecedented position, able to observe the two men driving the Greek army in what will become their final confrontation, deciding the fate not only of Briseis's people but also of the ancient world at large.Briseis is just one among thousands of women living behind the scenes in this warâ€”the slaves and prostitutes, the nurses, the women who lay out the deadâ€”all of them erased by history. With breathtaking historical detail and luminous prose, Pat Barker brings the teeming world of the Greek camp to vivid life. She offers nuanced, complex portraits of characters and stories familiar from mythology, which, seen from Briseis's perspective, are rife with newfound revelations. Barker's latest builds on her decades-long study of war and its impact on individual livesâ€”and it is nothing short of magnificent.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":291,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.88"},"rating_count":5858,"review_count":1047,"genres":"Historical|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Fantasy|Mythology|Retellings|Fantasy|Historical","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1519448688l/37969723.jpg"}

That feeling of belonging can stick with readers the rest of their lives--but it doesn't come around as frequently for all of us. In this timely anthology, 'well-read black girl' Glory Edim brings together original essays by some of our best black female writers and creative voices to shine a light on how we search for ourselves in literature, and how important it is that everyone--no matter their gender, race, religion, or abilities--can find themselves there. Whether it's learning about the complexities of femalehood from Their Eyes Were Watching God, seeing a new type of love in The Color Purple, or using mythology to craft an alternative black future, each essay reminds us why we turn to books in times of both struggle and relaxation. As she has done with her incredible book-club-turned-online-community Well-Read Black Girl, in this book, Edim has created a space where black women's writing and knowledge and life experiences are lifted up, to be shared with all readers who value the power of a story to help us understand the world, and ourselves.Contributors include: Jesmyn Ward (Sing Unburied Sing), Lynn Nottage (Sweat), Jacqueline Woodson (Another Brooklyn), Gabourey Sidibe (This Is Just My Face), Morgan Jerkins (This Will Be My Undoing), Zinzi Clemmons (What We Lose), N.

They began as notes he jotted on the inside of his forearm in grease pencil and, later, as bullet points on the torn-off flap of an MRE kit. Whenever possible he incorporated those notes into his journals. Years later, he used those journals to write this book.Together, the stories in Bring Out the Dog offer a remarkable portrait of the absurdity and poetry that define life in the most elite, clandestine circles of modern warfare. It is a world of intense bonds, ancient credos, and surprising compassion--of success, failure, and their elusive definitions. Moving between settings at home and abroad, in vivid language that reflects the wonder and discontent of war, Mackin draws the reader into a series of surreal, unsettling, and deeply human episodes: In 'Crossing the River No Name,' a close call suggests that miracles do exist, even if they are in brutally short supply; in 'Great Circle Route Westward Through Perpetual Night,' the death of the team's beloved dog plunges them into a different kind of grief; in 'Kattekoppen,' a man struggles to reconcile his commitments as a father and his commitments as a soldier; and in 'Baker's Strong Point,' a man whose job it is to pull things together struggles with a loss of control.Told without a trace of false bravado and with a keen, Barry Hannah-like sense of the absurd, Bring Out the Dog manages to capture the tragedy and heroism, the degradation and exultation, in the smallest details of war.","edition":"","format":"Hardcover","pages":173,"rating":{"$numberDecimal":"3.90"},"rating_count":193,"review_count":59,"genres":"Short Stories|Fiction|War|War|Military Fiction|Literature","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1517199717l/35458140.jpg"}

The CIA concocted a cover story for President Eisenhower to deliver, assuring him that no one could have survived a fall from that altitude. And even if pilot Francis Gary Powers had survived, he had been supplied with a poison pin with which to commit suicide.But against all odds, Powers emerged from the wreckage and was seized by the KGB. He confessed to espionage charges, revealing to the world that Eisenhower had just lied to the American people--and to the Soviet Premier. Infuriated, Nikita Khrushchev slammed the door on a rare opening in Cold War relations. In A Brotherhood of Spies, award-winning journalist Monte Reel reveals how the U-2 spy program, principally devised by four men working in secret, upended the Cold War and carved a new mission for the CIA.
